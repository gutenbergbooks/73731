<h2 id="FOREWORD">FOREWORD</h2>
</div>

<p>Let us reason together. What proof have we that the
people of one race are better or to be considered with favor
above those of another?</p>

<p>It is true there was a time when the word “stranger” or its
equivalent in other languages than the English had the same
meaning as enemy. Each savage tribe, the early ancestors
of all civilized peoples, for want of knowledge and experience,
considered all other tribes enemies, and even as civilization
grew and boundaries began to be established an
imaginary line made enemies of those dwelling on opposite
sides of rivers and channels. With more reason, seas came
to be recognized as territorial limitations, and it has required
centuries to break down notions of enmity and antagonism
between dwellers of different localities. Indeed, it can
hardly be contended that this spirit of enmity and antagonism
has been overcome, when we see not only peoples of
different countries, but those of a common citizenship harboring
animosities sometimes approaching the malignant,
and giving expression both in speech and action to their
hatred for those who differ from them in race or color or
creed.</p>

<p>Victor Rubin in the following pages deals with this question
of racial and religious antagonism in a fascinating but
most effective manner. Perhaps no one will be able to
speak more impressively of Mr. Rubin’s book “<span class="smcap">Tar and
Feathers</span>” and at the same time give an intimation of its
contents than has the great scholar and traveler, Israel
Zangwill:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Mr. Victor Rubin, with the courage of youth, faces in his first
novel the full blast of the actual. What Mr. C. E. Montague’s fine
book, Disenchantment, expresses for the British soldier, Mr. Rubin’s
Tar and Feathers expresses for the American. All <span class="lock">America—</span>of all
creeds and <span class="lock">races—</span>went to the great war as one man, as depicted in
Tar and Feathers. The young Southerner, Hamilton, has actually
been dragged from death on the battlefield by a negro and brought
back to life and health by a Jewish surgeon. Yet the cannon have
scarcely cooled before the old racial and religious prejudices reassert
themselves. They resurge even in Hamilton, who cannot bear to touch
the colored hand of his saviour. It is his struggle with them, and
his final mastery over them, that constitutes the theme of Mr. Rubin’s
novel. When Hamilton goes back to his narrow Southern home, he
even under the pressure of the milieu becomes a paid agent of the
Ku Klux Klan with its crusade against Catholics, Jews and Negroes.”
(Mr. Rubin prudently calls it the “Trick, Track Tribe.”)</p>
</div>

<p>That the book possesses a broad appeal is indicated by
many other commendations of able readers as expressed in
scores of periodicals, a few of which we quote:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“A cogent, common-sense appeal for liberality of view, for a
realization that all humanity is intrinsically similar, that the great
teachers of mankind all breathed love and unity ... a book
which any man concerned with the interesting presentment of truth
would do well to read.”—William R. Langfeld in the <cite>Philadelphia
Sunday Record</cite>.</p>

<p>“Mr. Rubin has succeeded in analyzing the psychological effects of
the war upon those who participated in it as few writers have done.
He has depicted the ethical and moral metamorphosis with commendable
accuracy and understanding.”—<cite>Boston Transcript.</cite></p>

<p>“Tar and Feathers is noteworthy in that it protests vigorously
against prejudice of every variety and exposes the narrowness and
the danger of organizations making for racial antagonism. The
author writes with sincerity and conviction and is worth heeding if
only for the vehemence with which he attacks the forces of snobbery
and prejudice.”—<cite>New York Evening Post.</cite></p>

<p>“While the armistice bells are ringing and a war-ridden people all
over the world are shaking themselves loose from the habits of four
long years, the novel opens in a crowded ward of the American
hospital, Rue de Saint Jacques, Paris. Robert Hamilton, a rich
and cultured American from Georgia; McCall from Chicago, in
civilian life a reporter on the Times (incidentally of the Catholic
faith); Dr. Levin, the great American surgeon, and Williams, a
negro graduate of Harvard, are here introduced. Of course, there
is also Meadows, the <span class="lock">nurse—</span>Dorothy Meadows, who played around
with the social service crowd at Madison, and graduated there some
time “before the war.” Back in Georgia is Margaret, a typical
“home girl” in Corinth. These are the leading characters out of
whose reactions Mr. Rubin has evolved a presentable story upon
which to drape his theories.</p>

<p>“The scene shifts back to Corinth, where young Hamilton, is at
once entangled in the affairs of the Ku Klux Klan, tho he doesn’t
know in the least what it’s all about. Sent on a mission of propaganda
to Chicago, Hamilton renews his friendship with McCall and
Levin. The story of the part they play is a sermon to be hugged
to the hearts of all 100 per cent Americans. Then, of course, there
is Dorothy ... while back in Corinth is Margaret ... staying
at home.</p>

<p>“Mr. Rubin makes adroit use of the Chicago race riots of 1919 and
otherwise molds his men and his times into a tale which moves with
rapidity and vigor.”—Margaret Evans in the <i>Chicago Evening Post</i>.</p>
</div>

<p>For ourselves, we have read nothing on the perennial
subject of intolerance so much to the point and so well calculated
to allay prejudice and make for good citizenship as
“<span class="smcap">Tar and Feathers</span>.”</p>

<p>Monday, November 11, 1918, in Paris. A world suddenly
gone mad. Shouting and dancing in the streets. Blaring
of bands in the public squares. Booming of cannon along
the Seine. Ringing of bells. Swirling masses of human
beings along the boulevards and bridges and upon the steps
of public buildings. Color. Autumn trees aflame with gold.
Men and women blown about like autumn leaves. A sea of
people, tossing sprays of <span class="lock">color—</span>red caps of officers, sky-blue
uniforms, yellow hair of dancing women, ribbons, waving
flags and banners. Spots of <span class="lock">black—</span>women in mourning,
laughing and crying at once, singing through tears.
Shouts of <i lang="fr">vive la France</i>! Singing of the Marseillaise. Incoherent
laughter and singing and cries, forming a rhythmic
pattern like the pulsing of sea waves.</p>

<p>Peace at last. The world made safe for <span class="lock">democracy—</span>for
France, for England, for Italy, for Belgium, for <span class="lock">America—</span>for
the smallest nations of the <span class="lock">earth—</span>for white men, for
yellow men, for black men.</p>

<p>At the Chamber of Deputies, Premier Clemenceau, faultlessly
attired and gloved, tells the French people that the
greatest war of all time has come to an <span class="lock">end—</span>Clemenceau,
who nearly fifty years before as a member of this same
assembly, voted against surrender to Germany. As his
proud, clear voice rings out, the guns of victory roar a distant
accompaniment. Wild applause greets his reading of
the terms of the armistice, especially marked at those paragraphs
dealing with the return of the lost provinces of
Alsace-Lorraine, the abandonment of submarine warfare,
the occupation of the left bank of the Rhine.</p>

<p>For once there are no political factions in the Chamber.
For once lefts, rights and centers applaud and cheer as one.
Even the Socialists are among those to surround the Premier<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
as he leaves the platform, and congratulate him. Some one
begins the Marseillaise. Immediately applause, laughter and
cheering are hushed. The Deputies stand erect and sing in
unison the hymn of the French Republic. The vast crowd
which has been thronging the galleries and corridors takes it
up. It is carried to the hundreds massed on the stairs and
perched on the railings. From group to group, as far as one
can see, the song is carried along the current of exultant
humanity. Men and women fox-trotting in the public
squares and dancing in circles pause to sing. Then back to
their dancing. Another circle farther on takes up the hymn.
And so it goes, from the House of Deputies to the boulevards,
and along the boulevards to the bridges. From the
Bastille to the Madeleine, down Rue Royale to the great corral
of captured German guns in the Place de la Concorde,
up the Champs Elysées, on and on and on. It is Paris
triumphant.</p>

<p>Other nations take up the Marseillaise, sing it and their
national <span class="lock">anthems—</span>the Star-Spangled Banner, God Save the
King.</p>

<p>British soldiers on leave begin a procession and go shouting
and singing down the boulevard. Columns of Americans,
French and Belgians follow their example. Women
throw themselves into the arms of the marching soldiers,
kiss them and are off again. At the Elysée Palace the procession
halts just long enough to sing the national anthems
of the allied nations, in succession, and marches on.</p>

<p>Crowded motor busses and other vehicles find every highway
blocked, and the passengers dismount and join the
throngs. Men and women who have never met before join
hands, embrace, kiss, dance and sing. Every public square,
the street before every outdoor café, the great hall of St.
Lazarre <span class="lock">station—</span>yesterday the receiving station of the
<span class="lock">wounded—</span>become dance halls.</p>

<p>On the steps of L’Opera a Scotch band is blaring. It is
one of a hundred bands playing simultaneously.</p>

<p>There is a deluge of wine. Countless bottles are uncorked
or impatiently cracked open at the cafés. Men and women<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
dart down the streets brandishing bottles and sharing their
contents with others. American soldiers forget the regulation
against liquor.</p>

<p>They forget another <span class="lock">regulation—</span>General Order 40, forbidding
colored men to talk to French women. The French
have not learned to draw the color line. French midinettes
and society women join hands with the colored men who
have saved France, as freely as with the whites. An aristocratic
Parisienne embraces an Alabama negro, while the
latter grins good-naturedly, and the celebrators form a circle
about the two.</p>

<p>“They’d sure lynch him for that,” sneers another Alabama
soldier, white, with a scowl, as he leans tipsily against the
railing of La Madeleine. It is the one note of discord in
the otherwise perfect harmony of the moment.</p>

<p>“I say,” his voice rises petulantly, “they’d lynch him—”
But the men in uniform about him are English, French,
Italian. Can’t explain a thing like that to Tommies, Frog-eaters
or Wops. Probably wouldn’t know what lynching
meant anyway. And they treated niggers like white people.</p>

<p>But he forgets his resentment when a girl with dancing
black eyes grasps his hand and that of one of his French
colleagues and begins dancing down the street with them.</p>

<p>Out of the gathering twilight, stars of light suddenly <span class="lock">flare—</span>electric
lights, search-lights, gas lights, lanterns. Paris,
which has lived in darkness for four years, suddenly bursts
into an orgy of colored <span class="lock">lights—</span>glitters like an enchanted
city.</p>

<p>Into the city of lights and shadows, the sea of exultant
humanity, they drift. They are part of the city, of the
world suddenly grown mad with joy. Throughout France
other men and women are celebrating like this. In England,
in America, in Italy, in Belgium. Peace. Victory. The
end of Tyranny. Freedom for all!</p>

<p>Of all this, Robert Hamilton, first lieutenant of infantry,
was unaware.</p>

<p>In a crowded ward of the American hospital, on Rue de
Saint Jacques, he was just emerging from ether. High
explosive had shattered one of his ribs and had come within
an ace of sending the jagged bone into his heart. A skilful
surgeon had cut away bits of bone, substituted a plate of
silver and stitched the skin back again. Of this also,
Hamilton, of course, knew nothing. His last memory
was of leading a wave toward a trench. Running ahead of
the wave, running at a dog trot, with a rifle held at high
port across his body, running through mud and shell holes,
running into a grotesquely lighted night, with lights and
rockets that screamed overhead and exaggerated every
irregularity of the ground, that sent ghastly shadows staggering
across the field and outlined the opposing trenches.
Running, still running.</p>

<p>In the back of Hamilton’s brain something <span class="lock">burned—</span>a
light, a flame, a pain, an idea. It was all that lived of that
complex <span class="lock">being—</span>Hamilton. It was all that lived of his hopes
and fears, his loves and prejudices, his habits and thoughts.
A childhood in Corinth, a youth at prep school, four years
of training at Harvard, generations of culture, all lay concentrated
in a little feeble flame that was flickering,
flickering.</p>

<p>The flame grew outward and shattered into other flames.
The light expanded, throbbing. The pain grew sharper.
Hamilton was beginning to think. Before he had simply
been conscious of his existence.</p>

<p>Now he was running forward again through the grotesquely
lighted field of battle. Running, running, with
rockets and Verey lights and flames forming a pattern in
his brain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span></p>

<p>Then sounds throbbing through his <span class="lock">consciousness—</span>forming
another pattern. Cries, shouts, the booming of cannon,
the whirring of shells and unseen wings, singing.</p>

<p>Then his brain reeling around.</p>

<p>Flames searing his breast.</p>

<p>Hamilton’s eyes fluttered open to a white ceiling. He became
aware of a sickeningly sweetish odor of ether. His eyes
closed. He was back in the gray world, with its weird, screaming
lights. Running, running. He was falling, with bayonets
flashing out of the shadows and tearing at his chest.</p>

<p>“Get ’em! Get ’em! God! They got me. Sergeant!”</p>

<p>His eyes fluttered open again. Eyes were resting on his
bewilderingly.</p>

<p>“What? Where am I?”</p>

<p>Soft hands were patting him.</p>

<p>“Where are you, sergeant? All right, bombers! Get
’em! Get ’em! Damn!”</p>

<p>Hamilton was conscious. The pain had concentrated in a
single place in his chest. He saw a surgeon and a nurse in
white bending over him. He knew that he was in a hospital.
He heard the nurse’s low voice consoling him:</p>

<p>“You’re all right, now. A few days and you’ll be sitting up.”</p>

<p>The surgeon was giving her instructions. Then he was
moving away to the next bed. Hamilton was noticing the
long room, crowded with white beds and the orderlies hurrying
about. Through the long row of tall windows the bright
autumn sun was shining.</p>

<p>“What’s the noise?”</p>

<p>“The armistice’s been signed.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“The war’s over!” The nurse was patting his forehead.</p>

<p>“What? The <span class="lock">war—</span>over?” He was struggling vainly to
get up, his will sending the blood into his emaciated muscles
and tensing them. For a moment his eyes, glancing through
the window to the world <span class="lock">outside—</span>saw the sea of frenzied
men and women, dancing, singing, laughing, weeping, shouting.
Then he sank back again to his pillow, suddenly white,
tears streaming down his cheeks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span></p>

<p>“War’s over! War’s over!” he repeated in a choked
voice.</p>

<p>His brain whirled with emotions. Joy that the war was
over, that danger and hardships were at an end, that he
would be able to return <span class="lock">home—</span>home and Margaret. Somewhere
was a faint shadow of regret that the war had not
lasted long enough for him to have won his captaincy. His
grandfather had been a captain in the Confederate army.
Two ancestors had been captains in Washington’s army.
Hamilton had been brought up in the fighting tradition and
in the officer tradition. And he had been recommended for
promotion by his battalion commander.</p>

<p>Hamilton’s eyes swept the room. Several of the other
patients were standing at the windows, looking down upon
the crowded streets. Others were sitting up in bed or in
armchairs. The rest were lying back, like himself, evidently
too ill to sit up. He turned his head and watched the faces.
On the next bed lay a bundle of bandages. It was moving
slowly. Hamilton watched fascinatedly. He caught a
glimpse of his face, and turned even paler. Then his face
flushed angrily.</p>

<p>“Nurse, nurse!” His voice rose shrilly. “There’s a
skunk in here.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“A skunk! Look over there! In that next bed.”</p>

<p>With strength borne of rage, Hamilton half sat up and
pointed a gaunt finger at the bandaged figure in the next bed.</p>

<p>“What’s that damn nigger doing here?”</p>

<p>Miss Meadows’ lips smiled, but there was an angry flash
in her brown eyes.</p>

<p>“The negro ward was filled and—”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you put him in the hall, in the basement,
anywhere?”</p>

<p>The lips still smiled.</p>

<p>“And we thought you wouldn’t mind if we put him next
to you because—”</p>

<p>Hamilton was silent with rage.</p>

<p>“Because he was the man who saved your life.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="III"><abbr title="Three">III</abbr></h2>
</div>

<p>When Dr. Levin returned later that day to change the
dressing, he found Hamilton still asleep. He was also asleep
the next day; but the third time, Dr. Levin found him
awake, his dark eyes fluttering restlessly about the ward,
like caged birds.</p>

<p>Hamilton, Dr. Levin decided, might be twenty-five or
twenty-six, an athlete and a person of social <span class="lock">position—</span>analyzing
people who came under his observation was one
of the surgeon’s hobbies. Weeks of unconsciousness had
left Hamilton pale and weak, but there was an appearance
of strength in his restless eyes and firm, ambitious lips. His
nose was slightly arched and the bridge at the highest point
a trifle thick as though it had once been broken; his jaws
broad, but tapering to a pointed cynical chin; his brow high
and narrow; his eyebrows thick without being <span class="lock">shaggy—</span>one
of them was scarred. A compromise between the intellectual
and the physical, Levin thought. He might have
made the Harvard football team or Phi Beta Kappa, depending
on his inclinations.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, Hamilton had not made Phi Beta
Kappa, although he had come comfortably near it, and had
made the football <span class="lock">team—</span>trying out for it only on the
insistence of a physical training instructor after he had
watched Hamilton for a few minutes on the wrestling mat.</p>

<p>Hamilton believed thoroughly in the old Greek ideal of a
sound mind in a sound body, but he held no exaggerated
idea of the importance of his ability to tuck a leather ball
under his arm and hammer his way through a line of opposing
men. He burned no incense at the altar of his egoism
as he had seen so many other football heroes do and he
expected no tribute. He enjoyed the game for its own
<span class="lock">sake—</span>the nervous expectation, the united purpose to win,
the quick strategy, the unexpected opposition, the physical
clash, the tug and strain of muscles, the smell of keen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
autumn air and of blood and leather. But football was
only a <span class="lock">game—</span>only part of his carefully planned scheme of
education. It helped provide the sound body.</p>

<p>His studies were the studies that a gentleman of leisure
of the old school might select for his son, with a few allowances
for modern standards. He had pursued the study of
Greek, for instance, only through Homer and of Latin
through Horace. He had taken the minimum science
requirement, a single year of physics, and had then gone in
for contemporary literature and history. He had chosen
French for his foreign language. These studies he had
sprinkled with a few courses here and there in fine arts,
psychology and philosophy. Some were admittedly cinch
courses. He applied himself to these with reasonable zeal,
without, at the same time, endangering his social position
by being mistaken for a grind. He was giving himself a
foundation not so much for the establishment of a career,
but for the enjoyment of life.</p>

<p>As the son and heir of Robert E. Hamilton, owner of
extensive cotton plantations, cotton mills and hardwood forests
in Georgia, Robert, jr., had no particular need to establish
a career, and, although literature attracted him, he preferred
to enjoy rather than to try to produce it.</p>

<p>“There are too many writers already,” Hamilton would
say. “What we need are more persons who can distinguish
between good and bad writing. We need a larger dilettante
class, for the sake of the writers themselves, and as I have
no real inspiration I might as well belong to the dilettantes.”</p>

<p>This might have been either a streak of laziness or of
candor. Or again it might have been only the result of his
peculiar conception of aristocracy.</p>

<p>Hamilton was aristocratic as only a thorough Democrat
can <span class="lock">be—</span>that is a Southern Democrat. And his ideas came
by heredity. He believed, first, in the absolute supremacy
of the white race, as distinguished from the colored races;
second, of the Anglo-Saxon as distinguished from the rest
of the Caucasian race; third, of the residents south of the
Mason and Dixon line, as distinguished from the rest of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
Anglo-Saxons; and fourth, of the Hamiltons. Although he
no longer attended church regularly, he was a firm believer
in <span class="lock">God—</span>a deity not unlike the oil paintings of the ancestral
Hamilton, who had received the grant from <span class="lock">Oglethorpe—</span>only
infinitely more powerful and grand. Hamilton’s God
was a god of the cotton plantations and the mills, although
Hamilton himself would have been the first person to deny
it. His voice was heard in the thunder and His rain made
the cotton plants to grow. His hand could be seen ruling
the waters and turning the wheels of the cotton mills. His
anger flashed in the lightning and was seen in the uprisings
of white men to stamp out transgressions of His law.</p>

<p>Yet it was a just God and a beneficent one; for though it
had been God who had created the different races and
classes and who had destined some to rule and others to be
ruled, He gave to all alike the beauty of sunsets and sunrises,
of misty mountain peaks, of majestic expanses of
ocean, of flowers and forests. And He allowed the rain to
fall alike on the highest white man in His caste, and upon
the lowliest black.</p>

<p>At college Hamilton’s conceptions had broadened sufficiently
for him to admit that all of God’s people were not
concentrated south of the Mason-Dixon <span class="lock">line—</span>though they
might be more thickly settled there.</p>

<p>His first contact with theories of evolution advanced fifty
years ago, but new to him, for a time threatened to shake his
belief in the god of the clan, but eventually he absorbed the
new teachings and catalogued them as part of the inscrutable
plan, the mysterious ways in which God moved His wonders
to perform.</p>

<p>All this sounds very ponderous for a young man at the
threshold of life. As a matter of fact, these concepts played
but a small part in his actual life. He was fond of outdoor
sports, tennis and golf, had gone on several fishing trips in
northern Maine with a Harvard chum, and was a fair horseman.
He had belonged to an exclusive club at Harvard and
held a membership in the best club in Corinth. He attended
all the dances in his set, sometimes led a cotillion, flirted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
lightly with the belles, took them motoring, was the life of
house-parties and had a reputation as one of the keenest
hands at poker in Georgia.</p>

<p>He drank like a gentleman and had an utter contempt for
anyone who couldn’t. Women liked him naturally, because
he was tall and athletic, conversed interestingly and could
make <span class="lock">love—</span>of the mock <span class="lock">variety—</span>delightfully. But he had
never carried his mild philanderings to the dangerous <span class="lock">stage—</span>far
less violated the code that holds a woman’s honor
inviolate—<em>in his own set</em>.</p>

<p>Robert was preparing to succeed his father in the control
of the Hamilton interests gradually. But neither father nor
son had any illusions about the inherent value or nobility of
learning the business from the bottom. Father and son
planned that when the time came for the younger man to
step into control that a competent staff should continue to
attend to all the details of the Hamilton enterprises, leaving
to the son only the outlining of broad policies. This
arrangement would leave Hamilton free to live his own life,
according to his own theories and untrammeled by business
cares.</p>

<p>Hamilton was living in a New York apartment, learning
the details of the distribution of cotton from the New York
office, and incidentally learning how to pick a Follies girl
from the first row, when the United States entered the
World War. He immediately applied for a commission in
the army and was accepted as an officer candidate at Plattsburg.
Here his ideas of inherent aristocracy received a jolt.
In the bunks adjoining his were a Jew who had worked his
way through the College of the City of New York and had
just entered the practice of law, and an Italian-American
who had formerly been a mounted policeman in Pennsylvania.
He found neither particularly greasy, as he might
have expected. Near him were men of German, French,
Norwegian and Southern European descent. Best of all,
however, he liked William McCall, New York correspondent
for a Chicago newspaper, a clever, whimsical sort of fellow
of Robert’s own <span class="lock">age—</span>a dreamer and a holder of startling,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
but interesting, theories of art, poetry and life. He was
a brother dilettante, with an added knack of <em>doing</em> <span class="lock">things—</span>besides.</p>

<p>McCall and Hamilton received second lieutenancies and
were assigned to the same company in the New York division
of the national army (the draft army). Here Hamilton’s
ideas received another jolt, for men and officers represented
every nation and creed. And here for the first
time the idea of such phrases as “the melting pot” and “the
army of democracy” began to sink into his consciousness.</p>

<p>His engagement to Margaret Forsyth had come quite
suddenly and logically. Since childhood they had frequented
the same circles. They had attended the same
dances and receptions. They had played, as children, in
each other’s homes, and made faces at each other across the
same table. When Robert was eight and riding through the
streets of Corinth on a white pony that caused all the children
in sight to shout envious “ohs” and “ahs,” he formed
the plan of eloping with Margaret. She agreed with
alacrity. When they had reached the outskirts of the city,
however, and Margaret discovered that it wasn’t a make-believe
elopement, she began screaming so loudly that
Robert was obliged to turn back. From that time on he
pretended to have a supreme disdain for the opposite sex.
In his fifteenth year, however, while home on a vacation
from “prep” school, he had once more succumbed to
feminine <span class="lock">wiles—</span>and intermittently thereafter.</p>

<p>The imminent departure of the troops for France, and
to what perils no one could say, stimulated the dormant
sentimentalism in Hamilton and, like half the young lieutenants
in the division, he woke up one day to find himself
engaged to Margaret, after she had come to camp with her
mother to visit him.</p>

<p>Now, as his eyes moved restlessly about the room, as if
looking for a means of escape, little incidents of his past
life came popping out from unexpected hiding places in his
brain. His mind had a trick of confusing two <span class="lock">events—</span>present
and <span class="lock">past—</span>and he felt vaguely he had been in this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
ward before. Then he remembered the operation on his
nose, after it had been broken in the Princeton game. It
made him suddenly homesick.</p>

<p>“You’re looking fit to fight,” said Dr. Levin cheerfully,
leaning over the bed and preparing to slip back the jacket
of Hamilton’s pajamas so that he could get at the wound.
“Just move your arm back a <span class="lock">little—</span>that’s the way. I suppose
you know it’s all over now?”</p>

<p>Hamilton nodded.</p>

<p>“You don’t know what a close call you had, I’ll bet.”
The surgeon deftly removed little strips of adhesive plaster.</p>

<p>“No,” Hamilton’s eyes were turned on the doctor. “Only
this infernal wound hurts like the devil. Nurse said <span class="lock">that—</span>that
nigger over there saved me.”</p>

<p>Dr. Levin turned around. The negro was asleep.</p>

<p>“Yes, he and a white officer picked you up near Chartreux
Woods.”</p>

<p>“Chartreux Woods? How’d I get there? That wasn’t
our objective, and anyway there weren’t any nigger troops
around. Last thing I remember I was heading across no
man’s land. Then something hit me.”</p>

<p>Hamilton scowled and noticed the quick skill with which
Dr. Levin was tearing bits of porous plaster and sticking
them on the edge of the bed, where they would be handy.</p>

<p>“I don’t know a thing about that,” said the surgeon,
intent upon his work. “Now just a minute while I wash
this. It won’t hurt. Did it? There now.” The dressing
was complete.</p>

<p>“If your chest hurts too much have Meadows call me,
but I think it will be all right.”</p>

<p>“Who’s Meadows?”</p>

<p>“That’s the little dark-haired nurse. They call each other
by their last names and sometimes we do too.”</p>

<p>“I’ve noticed her,” Hamilton’s eyes suddenly wandered
off into space. “Looks a lot like a girl I know back home.”</p>

<p>Dr. Levin smiled and patted Hamilton’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“You’ll be with that girl back home sooner than you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
think. Here, take this cigarette. A little smoking won’t
hurt you.”</p>

<p>“I’m dying for a smoke,” said Hamilton, thrusting out a
trembling hand. “It’s my first smoke <span class="lock">in—</span>What is the
date?”</p>

<p>Dr. Levin told him.</p>

<p>“In six weeks! Six weeks! God!”</p>

<p>The surgeon was off to visit his other patients and, after
a few puffs, Hamilton extinguished his cigarette and was
ready to sink back into sleep.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="IV"><abbr title="Four">IV</abbr></h2>
</div>

<p>It was from Miss Meadows principally that Hamilton
learned the details of his rescue. It was from her that he
learned, for instance, that it was McCall who had helped
the negro, Williams, to save his life. Where was McCall?
Meadows would not tell, although she hinted that it was
near-by. He guessed that it was in an adjoining ward and
that she was afraid that if she told him how close, he would
attempt to visit him before his full strength had returned.
Meadows had heard part of the story from McCall himself
and part she remembered from a newspaper account,
although names of places and persons had been carefully
deleted. There were other details that Dr. Levin supplied.</p>

<p>Apparently Hamilton had proceeded beyond his objective
and fallen wounded at the edge of Chartreux Woods just
before the enemy began to lay down a box barrage upon it.
Hamilton wondered how he had got there. His last memory
had been of advancing upon a line of trenches. Chartreux
Woods lay beyond and to the left.</p>

<p>“Probably out of your head,” explained Dr. Levin.
“You know there was a slight wound on your scalp. Probably
a machine-gun bullet.”</p>

<p>“Must have been that,” agreed Hamilton. “Only an
idiot would have done it otherwise.”</p>

<p>At any rate, it seemed, Hamilton had reached the last
line of trenches assigned as his objective and, while his
men were still mopping up, had blundered on. At the edge
of the forest, weak from loss of blood, he had fallen.</p>

<p>It was there that McCall, whose company was lying
entrenched opposite the wood, ready to advance when the
signal should come, saw him the next morning, through the
first gray of a drizzling <span class="lock">dawn—</span>the body of an American
soldier lying in the open a few feet from the first row of
trees and a hundred yards away. He did not know that it
was Hamilton, only that it was a wounded American. How<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
should he guess that it was Hamilton, who was supposed
to be holding a position to the right and rear of his own?</p>

<p>And now McCall had let himself lightly over the top and
was running swiftly through the mud toward his goal.
Suddenly the barrage upon the forest broke and McCall
flung himself to the ground. In a general way he knew
that the lowness of the ground would probably shield him
from observation, but to expose himself needlessly would
be folly. He began to crawl forward slowly. He would
continue this way for a few feet, then dive into a shell hole
or behind a stump.</p>

<p>Across the narrow field high explosive shells were shattering
the trees with thunderous roars. Projectiles
screamed and whined overhead. Somewhere a machine
gun chattered. A light drizzle was falling and all these
sounds seemed like a thousand angry thunders following
a thousand devastating lightnings. Once McCall threw himself
into a puddle a second before a high explosive shell
struck the earth a hundred yards away with a terrible crash
that shook the earth and spattered rock, earth and metal as
from a volcano’s mouth. McCall noticed with relief that
Hamilton lay protected by the sweep of the terrain.</p>

<p>McCall doggedly kept on. As he reached his goal, he
saw for the first time whom he was saving. Hamilton, his
buddy! McCall quickly tied his emergency bandage around
the wound in Hamilton’s chest, slid the prostrate form over
his shoulder and started back. A trickle of blood which
blinded his right eye told him that he had been wounded.
But it was no time to quit and painfully, his wound throbbing
with every step, he managed to stagger into a shell
hole. Then everything turned black.</p>

<p>In the meantime Williams, in command of a detachment
of pioneer troops assigned to McCall’s company, had been
watching breathlessly from a fire step in the front-line
trench. Now, when he saw McCall stagger into the shell
hole, he was over the parapet in a flash and wriggling
across the muddy, shell-torn ground like a snake. Half way
across, a spent fragment of shell struck his head and dazed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
him. But he kept on, as in a trance, and reached the two
white officers before his head cleared. McCall was recovering
consciousness and Williams bound his wound. To
his own wound he paid no attention. Then the two began
their return to the American line, dragging and pushing the
body of Hamilton between them.</p>

<p>Within the trenches all was excitement, and it was all
that the lieutenant in charge of the company could do to
keep every man in the front-line trench from swarming
over the top.</p>

<p>“They’ll bring him back!” he shouted. “There’s no use
any one else risking his life. Get down from the fire step
and stay down if you value your lives!”</p>

<p>The lieutenant swore and prayed in turn. The men recklessly
stuck their heads above the parapet and shouted
words of encouragement, although they knew that their
voices were no match for the thunder of the artillery.</p>

<p>“Come on now! Stick it out! Just a little longer!
Come on!” Their voices pleaded.</p>

<p>Inch by inch, foot by foot, they were creeping. They
had come within a few yards of the trench and the men
were shouting themselves hoarse.</p>

<p>“Come on! You’re almost there! Stick it out!”</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a terrific explosion that sent showers
of rock and mud into the trench and both Williams and
McCall rolled over, the blood gushing from many wounds.
Hamilton, between them, had been completely protected.
This time there was no holding them. A half dozen whites
and blacks were over the parapet and back again, bearing
the three wounded officers.</p>

<p>“You’ll get court-martialed sure as hell for this!” yelled
the lieutenant. Tears were in his eyes—“Or you’ll all get
cited for bravery.”</p>

<p>He was right. The next morning they heard from the
old man (the colonel). Every one of them, including
McCall and Williams, had been cited for conspicuous
bravery on the field of battle, over and above their line of
duty, in rescuing the wounded.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="V"><abbr title="Five">V</abbr></h2>
</div>

<p>Hamilton was sitting up in a wheelchair, watching Miss
Meadows flutter about from one patient to <span class="lock">another—</span>raising
or lowering a bed, adjusting a pillow, injecting morphine,
sponging a patient’s back, bringing <span class="lock">water—</span>doing a hundred
and one things. Hamilton admired her swift <span class="lock">skill—</span>the
sureness with which she did everything, the expertness with
which her capable fingers patted the bedclothes into position,
the gentle strength of her finely molded arm when she
lifted a man in bed or helped him to his chair, the dexterity
with which she snipped off gauze and linen and converted
them into dressing pads and bandages. Above all, her
cheerfulness.</p>

<p>At six each morning she would come into the <span class="lock">ward—</span>in
her familiar white sweater coat on the cooler <span class="lock">days—</span>and
take temperatures. She carried scores of thermometers in
a glass, it seemed, and as she moved from bed to bed she
would shake them down with a dexterous twist of her
wrist. Sometimes, on especially cold days, when her fingers
were numb, a thermometer would slip from her grasp and
shatter on the floor. But in spite of cold, and no matter
how little she had slept the night before, she invariably
smiled.</p>

<p>Meadows had a word and a nickname for everyone.
Hamilton was a “Colonel,” because of his first outburst
against having a negro in his ward, his Southern accent and
his rather aristocratic cast of features.</p>

<p>“In a few more days, you’ll have a regular goatee, and
then you <em>will</em> look like a colonel,” she used to tease him
when he was still lying on his back, unable to shave.</p>

<p>The patients were all her boys and she mothered them
in a delightfully impartial manner.</p>

<p>One of the men she maternally called “Sleepyhead,”
because he was always asleep when time came for taking
temperatures. Another was “Caruso,” because he snored
(she called it singing) in his sleep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span></p>

<p>“That was a most beautiful aria you rendered last night,”
teased Meadows, “it sounded like the Awakening of the
Lion from Hagenbeck.”</p>

<p>Then, as every one in the ward laughed, and before
Caruso could reply, she thrust a thermometer between his
lips. Caruso pretended to be in a great rage and in pantomime
drew a knife and threatened her with it.</p>

<p>“How’s the Great Lover?” she asked another, who had
come out of the ether revealing certain startling chapters
of his amatory experiences. “The Hearst papers have got
a reporter planted under your bed, so you had better be
careful of what you say in your sleep. They’re running
the first chapter of your memoirs, An Ethereal Affinity,
tonight.”</p>

<p>“You know I have only one love,” mocked back the Great
Lover, stretching out his arms.</p>

<p>“I wonder who that can be,” said Meadows and popped
a thermometer into his mouth.</p>

<p>“Great Scott, nurse, I’m burning up!” cried a patient.
Meadows snatched the thermometer from his hand to find
the mercury near the top of the column. It was an old
trick, however. The patient had held the end of a cigarette
to the bulb.</p>

<p>“My, oh my!” Meadows shook her head, so that the
brown curls straggled out from beneath her cap. “We’ll
have to cut out the nicotine. No more cigarettes from now
on, and you’ll see how soon your temperature goes back to
normal!”</p>

<p>“Not one cigarette, nursey?” pleaded the practical joker.</p>

<p>“Not a chocolate <span class="lock">cigarette—</span>unless you share it with
me!”</p>

<p>For each there was some bit of badinage that made the
dreary days of convalescence pass all the more quickly.
Even with the more serious cases, the officers whose jaws
had been replaced with pieces of metal strung together by
wire, the officers who had been blinded, the <span class="lock">amputations—</span>Meadows
joked.</p>

<p>Hamilton was making comparisons. He wondered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
whether the girl to whom he had become engaged just
before he left for France could have stood the gaff as well.
Physically they were remarkably alike. They could easily
pass for cousins, even sisters. They were both little women
and both had a girlish animation. Both were dark, with
wavy brown hair and large brown eyes. Eyes of a wild
doe, Hamilton used to say of Margaret. Meadows might
have been an inch taller and correspondingly heavier. But
the same domed forehead, refined nose, bowed lips.</p>

<p>Hamilton wondered whether Margaret, so graceful on the
dance floor, so competent in the drawing room, or at the
dinner table, would be equally at home in a hospital ward.
Could she have rubbed a man’s back with alcohol, or placed
a drain in a gaping wound as successfully as she poured
<span class="lock">tea—</span>do all these things with a smile? He wondered.</p>

<p>Meadows was approaching Hamilton’s wheelchair with
a cup of steaming chocolate, and for a moment Hamilton
had an acute longing to be back in the States, nearer Margaret.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, Colonel, hasn’t she written?” the
nurse smiled down upon him. “I’m quite sure I saw a
letter for you in the office. Orderly’ll be up in a few minutes.
Drink this chocolate. I made it myself.”</p>

<p>Hamilton took the cup and admitted that he was woefully
homesick.</p>

<p>“Some day,” he gulped and blinked hard. “Jimminy, this
stuff is hot!—some day I’d like to have you meet some one
in <span class="lock">Georgia—</span>Corinth. A girl I <span class="lock">know—</span>my—some one I
know real well. She looks a great deal like you, too. Same
complexion and same way of smiling. Might be sisters.”</p>

<p>“No,” laughed Miss Meadows, shaking her head, “I
haven’t a relative south of South Bend, Indiana. It’s just
a stage of convalescence. When they reach it, all my boys,”
she gave an expressive wave of her white arm, “tell me I
remind them of some one. So you’d better look out or
you’ll be mistaking me for her and telling me things meant
only for her shell-like ears. Oh, such things have happened
before!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span></p>

<p>Meadows shook her forefinger saucily at the colonel and
whisked away. Hamilton swallowed a burning gulp of
chocolate and felt more homesick than ever.</p>

<p>Meadows was right. There <em>was</em> a letter for <span class="lock">Hamilton—</span>a
letter which sent his heart thumping. It came in a square
envelope, lined with colored tissue, addressed in large,
round characters, in green ink and smelling faintly of
musk. A dozen postmarks and forwarding addresses
showed the course it had travelled. Hamilton had written
Margaret that he would spend his leave in Paris, the last
week in September, and she had addressed the letter in care
of the American Club. When Hamilton failed to claim
the missive, it had evidently been sent to headquarters.
From there it had been forwarded to his regiment. The
letter had followed the regiment from post to post, had
finally caught up with it and been sent on to the field hospital.
From there it had been sent to the American hospital
on Rue de St. Jacques, Paris. Evidently Margaret was
unaware that Hamilton had been wounded and had lain
hovering between life and death for two months. Hamilton
tore open the letter.</p>

<p>“Dearest Bobby boy,” it ran. “I know that some horrid
censor will be snooping through this, so I can’t tell you
how much I love you!</p>

<p>“I suppose you are in Paris now, enjoying your leave.
Oh, how jealous I am of those <em>notorious</em> French beauties!
I hear that they bob their hair, wear skirts up to their knees
and smoke cigarettes. How shocking! But you’ll always
be true to your little Margaret, won’t you?</p>

<p>“You don’t know how much we at home suffer! I don’t
mean by going without wheat or meat or heat on certain
days or without lights at night; nor even our untiring work
on drives and committees and meetings. I mean the gap
you have made in our lives <em>that nothing can fill</em>!</p>

<p>“Every one of us at home would give <em>anything</em> he could
to join you on the firing line. I know I would, if I were
a man. In the meantime I am ‘doing my bit’ by knitting
Red Cross sweaters and preparing gauze. I am attending<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
a class in hospitalization, so that I can help out in our local
hospitals in case all the trained nurses are accepted for
overseas duty.</p>

<p>“Papa is very proud of you. When he learned that you
had been recommended for a captaincy, he said that he just
<em>knew</em> that you had it in you, because you came from one
of the best Southern families. Father has so much responsibility
now, keeping the niggers at work. He says that his
overseers are working day and night to keep up the production
of cotton. Cotton is used in the soldiers’ uniforms
and in making gun-cotton, so father really feels as though
he’s doing his bit in fighting the Hun.</p>

<p>“Cousin George says he wishes he were in your shoes,
but the local draft board has ruled that his services in
editing a newspaper are indispensable, and of more value
to the country than shouldering a rifle.</p>

<p>“Howard <span class="lock">Pinkney—</span>the man you were so jealous <span class="lock">of—</span>foolish
boy!—still comes around and proposes regularly.
But there’s no chance, is there, against my soldier boy? I
hate these war profiteers, but papa says Howard is becoming
a splendid business man and doing a real service to the
nation by supplying the arsenals with walnut for rifle stocks.
It seems that walnut is the best wood for that purpose, and
at the beginning of the war Howard very thoughtfully
managed to collect most of it in the South. He said that
he would have liked to follow your example, but I suppose
he is doing more by ‘carrying on’ right at home, seeing that
the boys over there are supplied with rifle stocks.</p>

<p>“You see, <em>everybody’s</em> ‘doing his bit,’ one way or another.
I think it is <em>splendid</em>! It’s the only way that our Anglo-Saxon
supremacy can be maintained. Even at our dances
and receptions the note is patriotic. We invite all the
officers from the camps near-by and do our best to make
them feel as if they had not been forgotten. We always
end up with the <cite>Star-Spangled Banner</cite> and everyone stands
up so straight and sings <em>right from the heart</em>!</p>

<p>“A few foreigners and radicals have given us some trouble<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
by not subscribing their full quota of Liberty Bonds,
and the committee of twenty-one has daubed their houses
yellow. Some have even asked for higher wages, because
the war has made prices go up so high. But they don’t
realize their sacred duty to their country. There is talk
about the negroes revolting. Some agitators have been at
work amongst them. They’re demanding accountings and
cash, or rather hinting at it. They wouldn’t dare demand
it. It sounds like Bolshevism to dad! A Socialist came
here to <span class="lock">speak—</span>but the committee rode him out of town
on a rail before he could get a meeting and spread disregard
for Americanism and the Constitution.</p>

<p>“Dad and George and Howard say that the old Ku Klux
Klan ought to be revived to teach the negroes their place
and keep the agitators and other carpetbaggers from invading
the South.</p>

<p>“But I <em>mustn’t</em> bore you any more with this. I simply
wanted to let you know how the war was affecting the
South. Perhaps by this time the war will be over. I just
know when the Americans get upon the field of battle they
will show the rest of the Allies a thing or two about
fighting.”</p>

<p>Hamilton turned from his reading and looked out of the
window. The trees had turned gaunt and bare, heralds of
the approaching winter. People were hurrying to and fro.
Carriages carrying notables were dashing down the boulevards.
Officers in brilliant uniforms were moving about
the streets. Paris, following its first intoxication of victory,
was going about the complicated business of determining
the conditions of peace. Wilson’s fourteen points
were being adroitly broken. New conceptions of international
relations, the League of Nations, the autonomy of
<span class="lock">Montenegro—</span>bizarre and pathetic national points of <span class="lock">view—</span>were
being molded to suit the nations of the world. Pompous
international tailors were cutting up the economic
fabric of Europe, woven in the loom of the centuries, and
trying to form coats to clothe a confusion of political and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
sentimental ideas of nationalism. Experts were laying out
the patterns. No two agreed exactly.</p>

<p>Hamilton resumed his perusal of the activities of Corinth
during the last phase of the war, the town gossip, the state
of health of numerous individuals. He crushed the letter
and leaned back against his pillow. Thoughtless, chattering,
charming Margaret! If he could only crush her alluring
girlishness to him, and be aware of her pretty babbling,
without listening to it; simply nodding from time to time
and putting in a few words!</p>

<p>His chest was hurting him a little. He was growing
weak. It was the first time he had sat up for more than
half an hour. Meadows noticed him sink back in his chair,
quickly summoned two orderlies and had him lifted back
in bed, her capable hands patting the pillow into a comfortable
shape, and tucking in the blankets in a twinkling.</p>

<p>“Don’t swallow this, like Little Nemo over there,” she
said. “He eats everything I give <span class="lock">him—</span>soup, thermometers,
roast turkey, shaving <span class="lock">soap—</span>everything—a regular ostrich.
Now let’s take your hand. Something exciting in that
letter? What’s the matter with your pulse, colonel? Don’t
worry, I’ll get you back to her in ten days, good as <span class="lock">new—</span>if
I have to write my own prescriptions. Oh, it’s not so
high for a man in love. Temperature normal.”</p>

<p>Meadows made a notation on his chart at the foot of the
bed and then passed on to the next bed, and Hamilton had
a sudden desire to seize her white hand and hold it.</p>

<p>Hamilton was sitting at the window, his favorite position,
watching the stream of people on the street below.
He had walked up and down the room for perhaps five
<span class="lock">minutes—</span>the first time in <span class="lock">months—</span>and was now resting.
Little pains, like needles, were running up his limbs. His
wound had entirely healed, leaving only a long, livid scar.
Hamilton called the wound his barometer. He could foretell
any change in the weather accurately by the twinges
it gave him. At present it indicated “clear weather.”</p>

<p>Hamilton had begun to doze away in the warm sunshine,
when he heard a thumping of crutches down the corridor.
He turned around.</p>

<p>“If it isn’t old Ham himself!” cried the man on crutches.</p>

<p>“Bill McCall!” Hamilton was on his feet. “Where’d you
come from?”</p>

<p>The next moment they were shaking hands and looking
into each other’s eyes. Hamilton retained his grasp.</p>

<p>“I want to thank you, Bill, I want to tell you how grateful
I am for what you’ve done,” Hamilton began, his throat
choking. “I don’t know what to say; but I’ll always feel
indebted to you for <span class="lock">my—</span>life.”</p>

<p>“Oh, stow it,” cut in McCall. “It was no more than
any one else would have done under the circumstances.”
McCall slid into a chair, one leg held gingerly out and
deposited the crutches on the floor. Hamilton resumed his
seat. “As a matter of fact, the men you really owe your
life to are Williams—”</p>

<p>“The nigger? Yes, I suppose so.”</p>

<p>“And Dr. Levin.”</p>

<p>“Dr. Levin? Who’s he?”</p>

<p>“He’s your surgeon. Don’t you know him? Black-haired
fellow, blue eyes, little stoop-shouldered. Comes here every
day. Got a lot of other wards, too. Isn’t he still handling
your case?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, the doctor, sure. I didn’t know his name, though.
Levin? Jewish name, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Must be. Anyway it was Dr. Levin who really saved
your life. Williams and I simply brought your body back.
But you were hanging by a hair. It was Dr. Levin who
pulled you through.</p>

<p>“Don’t you remember reading about Dr. Levin joining
the <span class="lock">service—</span>giving up his big practice and all <span class="lock">that—</span>about
the time we left for training camp. I remember it because
I wrote it.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t <em>that</em> Dr. Levin, is it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, the big surgeon.”</p>

<p>“But he looks so confoundedly young and unassuming.”</p>

<p>“Well, he is young. Just a little over the draft age. I
remember covering the story at the time. Bob, you don’t
know what fine medical care we’re getting in this man’s
army. This specialist has made you a nice new rib out
of silver and spliced the pieces of bone together to the
plate, or bar, or something, so that the bone would form
over it again. What’s the matter, old man, you’re trembling.
Here, take this pill. I’ve got plenty.</p>

<p>“Now you’ve got a tin rib to match my aluminum shin
and my nickel-plated skull.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Look at this leg.”</p>

<p>McCall pulled up the leg of his pajama and revealed a
narrow, almost imperceptible scar.</p>

<p>“Feel it. Oh, it won’t bite you. A neat job. Now run
your finger over my skull here. That’s some more of
Levin’s work.”</p>

<p>“But it’s right next to the eye, that dent there.”</p>

<p>“Sure.”</p>

<p>“But you couldn’t have been hit there without losing your
sight. The shell would have cut your optic nerve.”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>Hamilton stared at McCall. “Well? You don’t mean
to tell me, <span class="lock">Bill—</span>not your eye.”</p>

<p>McCall shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, one eye’s enough, anyway. I can see everything as
<span class="lock">well—</span>Here, nurse, orderly!” His voice rang out. “He’s
fainted.”</p>

<p>But Meadows had already seen Bob’s head fall forward
against McCall’s knee, and the next minute Hamilton was
back in bed.</p>

<p>“Just a slight relapse,” smiled Meadows. “They get that
way when they’re not used to walking. Come in again
when he’s a little stronger.”</p>

</div>

<p>McCall, whose bed was in an adjoining ward, called
frequently. There was a possibility that his eyesight might
still be restored, but the operation was extremely hazardous.
It involved fastening together the two ends of the optic
nerve, close to the brain. As time went on the nerve tissue
would shrivel and recede, so that if McCall waited too
long the ends of the nerve would no longer meet. If an
operation was to be performed, it would have to be done as
quickly as possible. McCall could see perfectly out of his
right eye. A successful operation would restore sight to
the left eye as well. On the other hand, failure might
prove fatal.</p>

<p>Dr. Levin had laid the problem squarely before McCall
and the latter was pondering it seriously.</p>

<p>“I’ve a good mind, Bob, to give him a shot at it,” said
McCall one day, as they sat side by side on Hamilton’s cot.</p>

<p>“But supposing he fails?”</p>

<p>“Well, there’ll be one less newspaper man in the world.
I suppose The Times will have to find a new star reporter.
And there’s nothing I can do about it. Dr. Levin is like
fate. In his hands is the knife that will kill or restore my
sight. I think it’s worth the gamble. You have your eyes,
so you don’t realize what sight means. I know. When I
first came to they had a bandage over my eyes and I thought
I was totally blind. And believe me, I cried like a kid.
When they told me that one eye would probably be all right
and perhaps the other, I didn’t believe it.</p>

<p>“I thought of all the beautiful things I had <span class="lock">seen—</span>sunrises
and sunsets, mountain peaks, the ocean, Lake Michigan
in the morning, you know how it is, with the sun
dripping red and gold. There were things I had <span class="lock">forgotten—</span>paintings
and statues, and faces. They all came
back to me. I saw my mother, my dad, members of the
family, old friends. And colors. Did you ever see Paris<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
on Bastile day? An impressionistic painting after Monet,
with daubs of color all over <span class="lock">it—</span>brilliant reds and blues
and yellows and greens. Or a wood in Illinois in autumn.
And shadows. Foggy, drizzling nights with everything in
shadow, but the reflection from the pavement, and friendly
stabs of color from windows and street lamps. And moonlit
nights on river banks. <span class="lock">And—</span>but what’s the use.”</p>

<p>They were silent for a moment.</p>

<p>“But I thought you could see just as well with one eye,”
ventured Hamilton.</p>

<p>“Almost. Well, I’ve gotten used to it and I could get
along as well with one eye <span class="lock">if—</span>if I knew I could always
have that.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Well, as the tissue forming the nerve running to my
left eye shrivels up, it <span class="lock">may—</span>it might affect the other eye.
Those things happen. It might take two years, it might
take ten years, but sometime in the future there is always
that possibility, that chance of going blind altogether.</p>

<p>“I’m a gambler. I’d risk everything to keep my sight.
You don’t know. It’s worth everything!”</p>

<p>As the two friends discussed the advisability of the operation,
Dr. Levin loomed in their minds like a personification
of fate. The surgeon remembered McCall as a feature
writer for The Times and took a particular interest in
him. He would come to the two friends, as they sat together,
and join their conversation. They talked pleasantly
of art, literature, the effects of the war, the terms of the
treaty and women. At other times all three played cards.</p>

<p>Dr. Levin was a man of medium height, and with a
straight nose and blue eyes that belied his race. People
were continually telling him that he did not look like a
<span class="lock">Jew—</span>a fact which invariably nettled him. It was as if
people were saying that, whatever he might be on the inside,
outwardly he could pass for a man. In college he had even
been invited to join a Greek letter fraternity by some well-meaning
Christian colleague, not up on the art of trailing
one’s ancestry by one’s name.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span></p>

<p>When Dr. Levin spoke it was with nervous force. He
was forever anticipating other persons’ questions and
usually correctly. His mind ran nimbly from subject to
subject, and he was equally at home in a discussion on
anthropology and art. Persons who knew him casually
called him an “intellectual.” And there were subjects in
addition, that is, to his chosen field, surgery, in which he did
display scholarship. Psychology was one of these.</p>

<p>When Hamilton had thanked him for saving his life,
Dr. Levin had dismissed the matter by saying that it was
only a case, like any other of a thousand cases.</p>

<p>“From your viewpoint it may be a wonderful service
that I am doing, but from my viewpoint it is a remarkable
opportunity for study,” Dr. Levin had explained. “Well,
I’ll admit that patriotism had something to do with my
coming here.” His eyes twinkled. “But think of the wonderful
clinic I have before me. Hundreds of cases that the
average surgeon runs across once in a lifetime. Hundreds
of variations of injury that one would not find in a thousand
years in the largest hospital in the world. Each fresh
case a <span class="lock">problem—</span>an interesting problem to be solved. A
challenge to my skill and ingenuity. We surgeons evolve
new systems of treatment, new techniques, new theories,
as we go along.</p>

<p>“That is the best part of my work,” the surgeon went on
enthusiastically, “it gives one a chance to serve his community
and to express his own individuality at the same
time.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you feel any difference in your attitude when
you treat a case <span class="lock">like—</span>like that one?” asked Hamilton.</p>

<p>“Certainly not,” replied Levin. “There’s your snobbishness
creeping out. You’re probably a Southerner, aren’t
you? I thought so. The antipathy to the negro is interesting
as a phenomenon. It’s a problem in mob psychology.
But a surgeon cuts down under the skin of <span class="lock">man—</span>literally.
You’ve never seen a class in anatomy. Well, to the surgeon,
to the scientist, there isn’t such overwhelming proof
of the white man’s superiority. No, I don’t mean just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
physically. You remember how the Teutonic barbarians
swept over Rome. And the white men whipping the
Indians. It all seemed part of some divine scheme to keep
the inferior races subdued. The Nordic, including the
Teuton, you know, always has boasted of his physical
superiority. But now, when his physical superiority is not
so well established over the black, he argues that it is not
important.</p>

<p>“But <span class="lock">mentally—</span>The weight of the average negro’s brain
I’ll grant is slightly less than the weight of the average
white man’s. Yet the brains are almost identical. The stuff
in Williams’ brain is in all probability the same as in your
brain, Hamilton. It may be a little finer quality, or a little
poorer. There may be more of it or less of it, even though
you are a Hamilton of Virginia, or wherever it is, and
Williams, the grandson of a negro slave. As a matter of
fact, Williams is probably as well educated as any of us.
We’re all college <span class="lock">graduates—</span>McCall, you and I. Well,
Williams is a Harvard graduate. It doesn’t mean much,
if you or I are college men. Probably couldn’t help it.
Our parents mapped out our educational program for us,
but do you realize what it means to win a college education,
with the whole white world sneering at you and offering
obstacles to your path? And, of course, there’s poverty.
But that’s only a minor difficulty.”</p>

<p>“Oh, there are some smart niggers, I’ll admit,” said
Hamilton frowning, “but they’re the exceptions. Booker
T. Washington, this poet, Dunbar, I guess his name is.
And I’ve read some of DuBois in college, sociology class.
But the <span class="lock">mass—</span>Ugh!”</p>

<p>Hamilton made a wry face.</p>

<p>“Well, you’ve got to judge the negro race by the exceptions,”
said the surgeon. “Why? Because it’s only the
exceptional negro who’s had the same chance as the average
white man. You wouldn’t compare a man whose grandfather
had been a slave and his father practically a peon on
a plantation, a man without any schooling, with a man
whose ancestors had been freemen and who had enjoyed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
education for at least a few generations. If the average
negro had the same chance as the average white, the comparison
would be fair.</p>

<p>“But we’re drifting off into something that lies beyond
reason and argument and I just dropped in for a friendly
chat. I think you’ll be out in a week.”</p>

<p>While Levin was the scientist of the three, McCall was
the poet and the champion of human rights. While Levin
weighed and analysed, McCall rhapsodised.</p>

<p>McCall was enthusiastic about each claim for national
independence as it arose at the peace conference and was
recorded in the newspapers. He waxed eloquent not only
over the wrongs of Ireland, but of the Jews, and was more
of a Zionist than Levin, who sometimes doubted the practicability
of rehabilitating <span class="lock">Palestine—</span>building a country out
of a desert, investing millions of dollars, raising the hopes
of millions of human beings for the sake of an idea.</p>

<p>McCall was a poet in practise, as well as by inclination,
although he had allowed only a few of his most intimate
friends to set eyes upon his poems. He had several manuscripts
of plays and short stories tucked away somewhere
in a trunk at home, which he meant to publish to the
world some day.</p>

<p>Physically, McCall was not unlike Levin. McCall was
perhaps an inch taller and held himself straighter. But
there was the same boyishness of figure, and McCall had
dark hair and blue eyes as well.</p>

<p>Often when the conversation drifted to anthropology,
Levin would slyly compare the color of his eyes with those
of Hamilton and McCall. Hamilton had brown eyes. His
hair too was dark, although not so black as either Levin’s
or McCall’s, and he was cast in a larger mold, <span class="lock">physically—</span>within
an inch of six feet in height and broad of shoulder.</p>

<p>“You see what happens to your pure types,” laughed
Levin. “Here’s the descendant of the blue-eyed, fair-haired
Saxon with brown eyes and the descendant of the dark-skinned
Semite with blue eyes. You see all this pride in
race is after all based on a very slim physical foundation.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
All modern peoples are mixtures of many different tribes
and races. Even the Jew and the Chinese, who usually
boast of their racial purity. As for the <span class="lock">Englishman—</span>England
has been the melting pot, for centuries, of northern
Europe. Here you have the original Celts, the Angles, the
Saxons, the Jutes, the Danes, the Normans, probably some
Jews and any number of modern European strains. And
the Americans who boast of their pure English ancestry
might as well boast of being descended from Adam.”</p>

<p>McCall applauded these sentiments, but Hamilton
staunchly upheld the supremacy of the Nordic.</p>

<p>The day before Hamilton left the hospital, he had a
chance to thank Williams for rescuing him. Williams was
just regaining consciousness from a series of operations
that had riveted together bits of shattered bone in both
arms, a shin and one thigh. Only the thickness of his skull
and his powerful constitution had pulled him through, according
to Dr. Levin. He was lying flat on his back, looking
up at the ceiling when Hamilton leaned over him. His
arms and legs were still in casts and he was too weak to
observe closely Hamilton’s expression. The white man extended
his hand absent-mindedly, then suddenly realized
that the negro could not use his own. The latter smiled.</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” said he. “It is slightly discommoding.”</p>

<p>Hamilton flushed and stumbled about to find the right
words. Condescension, patronage, a sense of his own
awkwardness, genuine thankfulness appeared in his voice.
But the man who had saved his life grinned good-naturedly
and nodded. He was used to this air of patronage on the
part of white men. He understood.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="VIII"><abbr title="Eight">VIII</abbr></h2>
</div>

<p>Both Hamilton and McCall obtained sick leaves and
spent them in savoring Paris and Parisian life. There
were days of strolling down the boulevards, McCall limping
at Hamilton’s side, and “drinking in” the life of which
they had been deprived for so many months. “Drinking
in” was McCall’s own phrase, and it described better than
anything else the eagerness with which each new sight, each
fresh impression, was seized. There were wonderful afternoons
in the art galleries, with Hamilton absorbing his fill
of the old masters and McCall revelling in the modernists.
There were tramps through the public gardens, and visits to
the places of historical <span class="lock">interest—</span>the Bastile, the palaces at
Versailles, the public buildings. There were nights at the
music-halls and cabarets, where pleasure-seeking men and
women, casting convention to the winds, sought to crowd
into a few hours of drinking and dancing, all that they had
missed since the beginning of the war. Hamilton and
McCall were in a mad world, a world of jazz-crazed
mockers at morality, of civilized men and women suddenly
reverting to barbaric pleasures. The American craze was
at its height and in deference to it, negro musicians, dressed
in brilliant red and yellow, blared and sobbed weird melodies
to wild African rhythms. Prostitutes, with thin
veils to hide their nakedness, quivered and undulated to the
minor strains. Men and women danced in pantomimic
obscenities and suggested perversions.</p>

<p>“Let’s get out of this,” exclaimed Hamilton, “I’m no tin
angel, but, thank God, they don’t do this in America.”</p>

<p>“The funny thing about these frogs is that they think
they’re being American,” said McCall. “That’s all put on
for our benefit. Didn’t you notice how sweet everybody
has been to us here?”</p>

<p>Whenever Levin accompanied the two, he would point to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
the jazz music and dancing as an example of the moral
reaction that follows every war.</p>

<p>“It’s a sort of relapse, following a major operation,” he
explained. “We’ve cut out the Kaiser and perhaps Kaiserism,
although you can’t tell, the roots sometimes spread all
over the body, like a cancer. No, all the Kaiserism is not in
Germany. It’s here. It’s in England. It’s in America,
just trying to get a start. But whether the disease has been
definitely checked or not, we are going to pass through a
relapse. This is the social phase of it.”</p>

<p>There was a visit to a theatre, where a series of short
plays were being acted. There was a hideous horror play,
followed by the conventional adultery farce and then a
silhouette <span class="lock">novelty—</span>nude women dancing behind a sheet so
that their figures were projected by bright lights upon it.</p>

<p>Hamilton was disgusted. Dr. Levin simply classified it
as another symptom of <span class="lock">relapse—</span>he avoided the term “decadence”;
but McCall was amused.</p>

<p>“It reminds me of school children twiddling their fingers
at their teacher,” he laughed. “They’re so evidently produced
to shock. A blush or shiver in every line! Do you
remember when you learned your first naughty word, how
you looked up the synonyms in the dictionary and then
sprang them on your pals? With some it was more of an
obsession than with others, of course. They would chalk
up all the whoppers they could think on the sidewalks and
sides of buildings. Well, that’s what the French playwrights
are doing, and some of the poets and artists.
Freud might explain it by showing that their normal impulses
were checked in some way.</p>

<p>“I remember a Chicago newspaperman who got an overdose
of Havelock Ellis and Freud and the decadents, I
suppose. The result was a book with all the conventionally
naughty things trotted in, like the chalk marks of
an impudent schoolboy who hasn’t got enough outdoor exercise.
And when the book was suppressed, he enjoyed all
the sensations of the bad boy sitting on the stool with a
dunce cap on his head, wriggling his fingers at authority.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span></p>

<p>The ateliers, into which McCall’s newspaper friends got
the three friends entrée, were more to their liking. Although
here, too, Bill often found finger-wriggling at authority
for its own sake. Here, at least, the delusion was
honest. But in the drawing rooms they saw Paris in
deeper perspective.</p>

<p>Here were men of all countries and representing all
causes. Men in conventional black and white, sometimes
relieved by a ribbon across an immaculate shirt front or a
jeweled decoration; men in uniforms and in picturesque
native costumes. There were red men, yellow men, black
men and white <span class="lock">men—</span>men of all shades between. An Arab
sheik, in turban and flowing robe, come to sue for the
autonomy of a stretch of desert, conversed with the representative
from Albania, in Paris on a similar mission.
There were brilliant young Irish leaders and dreamers of
the national independence of Bohemia. Fighters for Palestine,
Polish nationalists, Hindu revolters, Persian revolutionists.
One could not move without bumping into the
holder of some claim of national autonomy.</p>

<p>“The trouble with them is that they’re all right, and,
therefore, all wrong,” said Dr. Levin. “One of them could
be right, or two, but here you run into twenty claims that
contradict each other. Every land believes its natural boundaries
to be the widest boundaries it can <span class="lock">get—</span>the boundaries
when Peter the Magnificent or Oswald the Resplendent
(some national hero that nobody else has ever heard about)
reigned. And, of course, the domains of Peter overlap
those of Oswald, who ruled a hundred years later. Each
country is <em>right</em>, that is as right as any other country. But
in this case, too many rights make everything all wrong.”</p>

<p>McCall sympathized with every national aspiration, and
when delegates learned that in civilian life he was a writer
on one of the great American newspapers they poured their
woes and hopes into his ear. Hamilton, as an orthodox
Democrat and admirer of President Wilson, listened
eagerly.</p>

<p>There were Russian emigrés galore, whose downfall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
caused McCall to chuckle, although it was harder to delight
in the fate of the mysterious Russian <span class="lock">noblewoman—</span>tall,
slim, straight-shouldered, with brown hair, high cheek
bones and great onyx-colored <span class="lock">eyes—</span>who hovered about.</p>

<p>There were other beautiful <span class="lock">women—</span>tall, fair English-women;
animated, little Parisienne brunettes; a few majestic
Americans. It was interesting to guess their nationality.</p>

<p>“There’s something about this I’m getting to like,” said
Hamilton. “This cosmopolitan atmosphere. I’ve always
been with Americans, of a certain class. Here one meets
people from all parts of the world. And it’s not just a
matter of having money, like in Chicago or New York.
Some of the most interesting chaps here have been the
painters and writers, fellows just struggling to get a hold
on things.</p>

<p>“During the war, when I was quartered in little villages,
I got an idea that the French were robbers, who tried to
stick the Americans for every cent they could. I got a
contempt for them because they didn’t have shower baths
and modern plumbing, and apple pie in the restaurants.
I see now, sanitary plumbing and all that is only one phase
of civilization.”</p>

<p>But though Hamilton was beginning to admire the intellectual
democracy of Paris, there was one aspect of it he
could not understand. He could accept the presence of
Chinamen and Japs and Hindus in the drawing <span class="lock">room—</span>but
the blacks! Sometimes a Senegalese war hero or even an
American negro would become the center of admiring men
and women.</p>

<p>Hamilton tried to explain the American viewpoint to his
French associates, but they generally shook their heads.</p>

<p>“White supremacy must be maintained at all costs,”
Hamilton was arguing with a young French colonel one
day.</p>

<p>“Well, what of it?”</p>

<p>“Don’t you see, if we allow them social equality, our
white race will disappear.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span></p>

<p>“Not if it is naturally superior, how can it?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t mean it will actually disappear,” went on
Hamilton, “but it will become something different. It will
<span class="lock">become—</span>mulatto. If we allowed the negroes equality, we
would become a nation of mulattoes.”</p>

<p>“Mon Dieu!” the Frenchman raised his arms in mock
horror. “You tell me your American women would all
choose black mates, if you allowed them to? Ha, Ha!”</p>

<p>Before Hamilton could think of a reply, McCall was
descending upon him with a vision in black taffeta.</p>

<p>He jumped quickly to his feet. For a moment he had
the illusion that he was back in a ballroom in Corinth.
Then he remembered who she was. The gown clung softly
to her so that it delicately suggested the wearer’s figure.
It was distinctly old-<span class="lock">fashioned—</span>like a gown Jenny Lind
might have worn, and there was a vestee of some fluffy blue
material and sprigs of blue forget-me-nots embroidered here
and there.</p>

<p>“Meadows! Miss Meadows!”</p>

<p>Meadows extended her hand and smiled.</p>

<p>“We’ve been looking for you, Colonel,” she said.</p>

<p>Hamilton presented Colonel Charbonneau and the latter
glanced in surprise at the single bar on Hamilton’s shoulder.
Meadows read his astonishment.</p>

<p>“‘Colonel’ is just an honorary title we’ve given him,”
she explained. “Because he’s so dignified and old-fashioned.”</p>

<p>Col. Charbonneau threw back his head and laughed.</p>

<p>“Are all colonels supposed to be so dignified?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I was speaking only of our southern American
colonels,” replied Meadows. “They’re a special variety.”</p>

<p>“But your young officer was very gallant in defending
the American women,” his eyes twinkled mischievously.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” flashed back Meadows, “they’re always defending
womankind, or the white race or Anglo-Saxon institutions
or something. And I sort of like it at that.”
She darted the flushed Hamilton a look out of her dancing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
brown eyes. “Women still live in an age of <span class="lock">chivalry—</span>at
least some of us do.”</p>

<p>They chatted for a few minutes and then Col. Charbonneau
excused himself, and walked away. McCall followed
a few minutes later.</p>

<p>“Do you know I expect to rejoin my regiment in a week?”
said Hamilton. “We’re going back together, McCall and I.
You see both of us got our commissions at the same training
camp and we’ve gone through the war together.”</p>

<p>“I suppose the war has bred pretty strong friendships,
hasn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes. It’s something like the college fraternity spirit,
only stronger. There’s McCall, for instance. I owe my
life to him. We’ll always be friends. And lately I’ve taken
a liking to Dr. Levin. I suppose I owe my life to him too.
He’s rather hard to understand at first.”</p>

<p>“Hard to understand? He’s simply deeper, more thorough
than the average person.”</p>

<p>“I suppose that’s it,” agreed Hamilton. “He criticises
things, has so many theories. But when you get to know
him he’s all right. You know I’ve never had much to do
with Jews before. Not for any particular reason, but because
I didn’t come in contact with ’em. But my experience
with Levin simply shows that there <em>are</em> some good
Jews. I’ve noticed that he’s more like the other men one
meets here. I suppose ‘cosmopolitan’ is the word. I suppose
you’ve made lots of friends, too.”</p>

<p>“With a woman,” mused Meadows, “it’s different.
There’s a certain ‘camaraderie’ among the nurses, but it’s
not the same thing as a man’s friendship. Women have no
such thing as friendship, in fact. Oh, I suppose I should
say seldom. Take man’s club life. Women may organize
for a special <span class="lock">purpose—</span>to study, to sew, to give plays, to
play auction bridge, to knit <span class="lock">sweaters—</span>but not for simple
friendship. Women in the same set are always antagonistic
to each other. They try to outdo each other in the matter
of beauty, of dress, of personal charm. They are always
competitors for the potential male.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span></p>

<p>“But you <em>have</em> friends?”</p>

<p>Meadows laughed. “It’s like this. When the <span class="lock">patients—</span>my
<span class="lock">boys—</span>are convalescent they become sentimental and
romantic. Sometimes this friendship, or whatever it is, lasts
after they’ve recovered. They come back and invite me
out, or bring me candy or flowers.”</p>

<p>“And then what?”</p>

<p>“And <span class="lock">then—</span>then they’re men and I’m a woman. They’re
disappointed and I don’t see them again.”</p>

<p>Hamilton’s eyes blazed and he clenched his fists.
Meadows noticed it.</p>

<p>“Oh, they’re not all like that,” she said. “Only most of
them. I have a few real friends, at least I think I have.”</p>

<p>“And am I—?”</p>

<p>“Oh, of course, you’re all right, Colonel. I could see
that from the beginning. I said there were <em>some</em> friends.”</p>

<p>“Well, in a week, I’ll be leaving—”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll meet again,” Meadows anticipated. “Probably
oftener than you think.”</p>

<p>Meadows always avoided sentimental entanglements.</p>

<p>“But I must see you again before I go.”</p>

<p>“Must?”</p>

<p>From across the room came the sound of some one singing
Suwanee <span class="lock">River—</span>a tenor voice, soft and sweet as a
spring night in Georgia.</p>

<p>“Yes, must. I’ve hardly talked to you for five minutes
straight. We happen to have been blown together here like
atoms of dust. Tomorrow we may be at the opposite ends
of the earth.”</p>

<p>“So you’d like to know more about this atom of dust,
before I’m blown away. Well, Colonel Dustman, you may
call for me Friday. I’ll have the afternoon off. That’s
only two days from now. If you can wait.”</p>

<p>Their hostess, the Countess Montfort, whose eyes had
been traveling from one face to another, like a mother hen
summoning her <span class="lock">chicks—</span>was approaching, her plump, pretty
face all solicitous smiles.</p>

<p>“Ah, I know you are both in such charming company,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
she pouted, “but would you not like to listen to the singing
from one of your countrymen? Monsieur Veeliams has
such a splendid voice.”</p>

<p>“Friday then,” Hamilton agreed. As Hamilton and
Meadows arose, the countess passed on to another group.</p>

<p>“That’s another one of my boys over <span class="lock">there—</span>singing—Williams,”
said Meadows.</p>

<p>“Williams? I don’t know any <span class="lock">Williams—</span>except the
nigger whose bed was next to mine.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s the one.”</p>

<p>“How’d he get in here?”</p>

<p>“The same way you <span class="lock">did—</span>walked. No, he didn’t either,
he came here in the countess’ own car. He’s still too bandaged
up to do much walking. But he got his invitation
the same way you did.”</p>

<p>“I thought mine had come through McCall.”</p>

<p>“Indirectly, perhaps. I happen to know the countess.
She wanted to meet some interesting Americans. So I gave
her your names.”</p>

<p>Williams’ face was hidden from Hamilton, but Hamilton
could see that in the circle of his auditors were members
of the flower of Parisian <span class="lock">society—</span>distinguished diplomats,
scholars, writers, women of striking beauty and brilliant
attainments. And epigram and pointed repartee were falling
from the African lips as adroitly as from the product
of the ripest European and Oriental civilizations. The
nigger was at home with them.</p>

<p>Hamilton’s face became contorted with rage, his fists
clenched.</p>

<p>“You don’t know what you are doing.” He tried to keep
his voice from rising. “These people don’t know. They
mean well. But if you’d lived in the South as a child and
seen what I’ve seen—”</p>

<p>He became suddenly speechless.</p>

<p>“<span class="lock">I—</span>I think I’ll not wait,” he finally said. “I’m going
back to the hotel.”</p>

<p>His dark eyes blazing, Hamilton turned and strode out
of the room. Meadows watched him in amazement. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
had admired Hamilton’s air of calm strength, his sincerity,
his deference to womankind. But she had never suspected
him capable of such an outburst of passion.</p>

<p>There was a lull in the other conversations which suddenly
carried Williams’ voice through the room. He had
been describing the attitude of colored soldiers on the eve
of battle. He told how the members of an infantry regiment
to which he had been attached sat on the fire-step,
a few hours before going over the top, harmonizing old
plantation tunes.</p>

<p>“Of course, I should have three other men to make it
sound <span class="lock">better—</span>to form a quartette. But you can get the
idea. Picture <span class="lock">it—</span>a cold, raw night, with the water falling,
drizzling; mud and rotting bodies; terrific explosions, like a
hundred boiler shops going at once; death and cold and hell
all over. Now imagine this as sung by the quartette—“Massa’s
in de Col’, Col’ Groun’.”</p>

<p>In a plaintive, vibrant tenor, Williams sang again:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0a">“<i>Massa’s in de col’, col’ groun’,</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>An’ we’s all gwine be with him in de mawnin’.</i>”</div>

<p>Promptly at noon, Friday, Hamilton was ringing the bell
at the nurses’ home. Meadows, enveloped in a blue cloak,
opened the door for him.</p>

<p>“Right on time,” she laughed, extending her hand. “Do
you wish to come in? All right, then, we’ll go ahead.”</p>

<p>Hamilton wondered what Meadows thought of his conduct
at the <span class="lock">reception—</span>his sudden <span class="lock">leaving—</span>his angry denunciation
of the colored <span class="lock">race—</span>as they walked together to the
curb.</p>

<p>Through the stark trees a bright December sun was shining.
Hundreds of students of the Sorbonne, a few blocks
away, were on the streets, coming from their morning
classes, talking, shouting, laughing, singing. Hamilton was
about to signal a cab.</p>

<p>“Oh, let’s walk,” said Meadows impulsively. “It’s such
a beautiful day.</p>

<p>“But first”—she halted, and shook her finger at him, “before
we go <span class="lock">on—</span>wherever we’re <span class="lock">going—</span>you haven’t told
<span class="lock">me—</span>you must promise not to run away from me in case
we should happen to run across Williams or some other
colored patient and I answer his greeting.”</p>

<p>“I suppose I do owe you an apology for my outburst at
the reception,” Hamilton replied. “But seriously, I don’t
know if I shouldn’t run away. That happens to be one
thing I feel strongly about. I suppose you’ve never lived
in the South.”</p>

<p>Meadows shook her head.</p>

<p>“Well, then, you can have no conception of what the
negro problem means to the Southerner. Of course I
shouldn’t have lost my temper. A person never should do
that. And the French, who before the war probably saw
a negro once a <span class="lock">year—</span>and then a genius, one of those freaks
that is apt to come out of any <span class="lock">race—</span>don’t understand.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span></p>

<p>“Well, maybe I don’t understand, either. And another
thing I don’t <span class="lock">understand—</span>where you’re taking me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I thought we’d have lunch at some restaurant and
then take in a vaudeville.”</p>

<p>“Let’s just ramble through the Luxembourg Gardens,”
suggested Meadows. “It’s only a few blocks away and it
will give us the afternoon to ourselves.”</p>

<p>“All right, the Luxembourg Gardens it will be then,”
agreed Hamilton. “Perhaps you could suggest the restaurant.
As a matter of fact, I’ve been seeing Paris mostly
by night, and specializing in only indecent cafés.”</p>

<p>Meadows did know just the café, only a few blocks down
Rue de St. Jacques and around the corner, a relatively
obscure place for most Americans, but the haunt of tourists
“who really know,” and the less impecunious students. It
was a rather unimposing place, from the outside. One
entered it after stumbling down a flight of decrepit stairs
and opening an ancient door. But inside everything was
inviting. It was called the Black Cat and everything was
done in black and orange, with black cats forming the principal
motif of ornament. Black cats ran around the wall
in a stencilled pattern and basked in front of the cozy fireplace
in the form of cast-iron statuettes. Hamilton noticed
that a log was blazing briskly. Black cats grimaced from
under the shades of the table lamps and from the salt and
pepper shakers. And, as Hamilton sat down, he noticed
that even the backs of the chairs were ferocious chats noirs.</p>

<p>The proprietor himself, or so it <span class="lock">seemed—</span>no other person
in the world could possibly have taken such an interest in
the <span class="lock">patrons—</span>greeted them with a smile and conducted them
personally to a table. He was a short, dark, stout man,
with carefully curled jet-black mustache, who smiled and
bowed perpetually, like an automaton.</p>

<p>One of a half-dozen waiters who had been hurrying
about, placed menus, decorated with hungry black cats, in
front of them with a flourish <span class="lock">and—</span>oh, so humbly!—suggested
dishes for the Americans’ consideration.</p>

<p>“Oh, you must try one of their omelettes. They’re<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
famous for them,” said Meadows. “Monsieur <span class="lock">Barbiton—</span>that’s
that grinning <span class="lock">Billiken—</span>can do more things with eggs
than any other three chefs in Paris, which means the
world.”</p>

<p>While waiting for their omelettes, Hamilton and Meadows
looked about the room. It was larger than one would
think upon first entering, much larger than one would
imagine from the <span class="lock">outside—</span>but cozy. There was a comfortable
clatter of dishes and a buzz of voices. The diners
were mostly Frenchmen and Frenchwomen, shrugging their
shoulders and gesticulating over their food. Here and there
appeared the sombre uniform of an American or English
officer.</p>

<p>“How much warmer every one seems here,” remarked
Meadows, groping about in her mind for the right adjective.
“Here they come to discuss <span class="lock">things—</span>art, poetry, philosophy,
politics. In a Broadway restaurant people come to eat and
get over the <em>business</em> as quickly as possible.”</p>

<p>Hamilton laughed.</p>

<p>“Oh, I suppose we’re too efficient. Afraid to waste time.
In the South, though, we take things a bit easier.”</p>

<p>“But are we Americans really so efficient?” queried
Meadows. “We hurry about a great deal, but do we get
anywhere?”</p>

<p>“Well, we are tremendously advanced in technical <span class="lock">matters—</span>in
machine production. We can make things faster
and cheaper than any other country in the world. The
average American workingman probably produces twice as
much as the best workingman in Europe.”</p>

<p>Hamilton paused. The waiter was approaching with a
tray of hors d’œuvres—olives, radishes, appetizing little fish
that Hamilton failed to recognize. He selected a radish and
emphasized points with it between bites. He was entering
into the atmosphere of the place.</p>

<p>“But in order to get this production, the business man
has to work like the deuce. He’s at his desk early in the
morning and late at night. He runs into a restaurant at
noon, grabs a ham sandwich, a piece of pie and a cup of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
coffee, eats it in a cramped position from the arm of a
chair, and rushes back again. He’s not a captain, but a
slave of industry.”</p>

<p>Hamilton went on lugubriously, with mock dramatic
force. “There’s your plutocrat. Your silk-hatted, obese
gentleman of the cartoons. As a matter of fact he is usually
thin and suffering from dyspepsia. This is the object of
the attack of the representatives of the pee-<span class="lock">pul—</span>the demagogues.
This is your hated capitalist. I prefer the man
who has sense enough to see that there is nothing essentially
noble in work and who devotes his time to the pleasures
of life.”</p>

<p>Over the omelettes, which after the first bite, Hamilton
decided were worth all their reputation, the discussion was
resumed.</p>

<p>“Isn’t that a rather narrow view to take?” asked Meadows.
“Devoting one’s life to mere pleasure.”</p>

<p>“It’s the very highest. What are the higher things in
life but means to increasing our pleasure? What is all our
<span class="lock">culture—</span>manners, art, literature, music? Even religion is
the sole pleasure of the millions who are too incompetent
or unfortunate to enjoy the material pleasures of life, the
pleasures of the flesh. There is no rational occupation for
man, aside from what is absolutely necessary for his subsistence,
except the pursuit of pleasure.”</p>

<p>“But haven’t you any place for duty in your philosophy?”
put in Meadows. “Your views are interesting, but obviously
only applicable to a small class. Obviously every
one couldn’t go about hunting pleasure.”</p>

<p>“Certainly, it’s a class philosophy,” replied Hamilton. “I
don’t pretend to prescribe a philosophy that fits every one.
It’s simply my own private brand. It would be just as
ridiculous for me to have a philosophy that is more universally
applicable, as it would be for me to drink beer instead
of Château Yquem, because it suits more palates.”</p>

<p>“And you don’t care about the beer drinker?”</p>

<p>“On the whole, he’s just as well off as your average
American capitalist. He eats more, sleeps as long, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
satisfies practically the same desires. Both read the same
newspapers and attend the same movies. And the beer
drinker doesn’t have to worry about his wife eloping with
the chauffeur.”</p>

<p>“So you admit the morality of the beer drinkers, only
I don’t like that term.”</p>

<p>“That,” interrupted Hamilton, his eyes gleaming, “is because
your appetite also has been developed beyond the beer
stage.”</p>

<p>“Anyway you admit that his morality is higher.”</p>

<p>“Not at all. His wife very obviously cannot elope with
a chauffeur, because there’s no chauffeur to elope with. In
fact, she may already be married to him.”</p>

<p>They both laid down their forks and laughed.</p>

<p>“You’ve aroused a tremendous appetite in me for Château
Yquem,” said Meadows mischievously. And Hamilton
ordered a bottle, after the waiter had assured him that the
oldest bottle in Paris lay in the wine cellar of the Black
Cat.</p>

<p>“After a swallow I may learn to appreciate your point
of view better,” she said.</p>

<p>“There’s no pleasanter way of learning that I know of.”</p>

<p>Hamilton watched Meadows lift the glass to her lips, her
dark eyes sparkling as brightly as the yellow wine. He had
never noticed how charmingly her lips were curved before.
A ridiculous idea came into his mind and he promptly dismissed
it. Certainly he was not falling in love with her.
This was merely <span class="lock">companionship—</span>intellectual companionship.
And, of course, there was Margaret, to whom he
was engaged and whom he really loved. Meadows made
a little face, whether it was expressive of dislike or of
coquetry Hamilton was not certain.</p>

<p>“Boo!” said Meadows, setting it down. “I’m afraid I’ll
have to remain a plain American bourgeoise.”</p>

<p>“You couldn’t do that,” Hamilton made a mock bow,
supposed to be imitative of the restaurant proprietor. “You
couldn’t, even if you did remain a bourgeoise.”</p>

<p>“You’re perfectly horrible today, Colonel!” Meadows<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
laughed. Over his wine and pastry he watched the changing
expressions in her face. Were her eyes actually larger
than Margaret’s? There <em>was</em> a resemblance between them.
Meadows seemed more cosmopolitan, yet hardly less girlish.
He watched the high lights in her hair, where the sun fell
on it through the window. Then her lips again. They
were very much like Margaret’s. He wondered whether
she would go out with other officers after he was gone.
Probably, he decided. And would he ever see her again?
He imagined Margaret meeting Meadows and perhaps
thanking her. He was conscious of her voice going on and
it soothed him in a strange way. Vaguely it made him
feel as though he were with Margaret. This, he reasoned
with himself, was no treachery. Meadows was simply a
medium for the expression of a certain mood. She represented
Margaret.</p>

<p>“I bet you haven’t heard a word I said.”</p>

<p>Hamilton came out of his trance.</p>

<p>“Why, yes I have.” He groped blindly. “You were
asking me <span class="lock">if—</span>if—”</p>

<p>“See, you haven’t been listening to me. You’ve sat that
way for ten minutes, staring at something.”</p>

<p>Hamilton didn’t wish to say it, fought against saying it,
and said it, although still in his tone of light banter.</p>

<p>“I was staring into your eyes. You know how one loses
oneself while gazing into a crystal.”</p>

<p>Now that he had said it, it sounded flat, stilted. But
even so, flattery of some kind was his only possible defense.
Meadows made a little bow.</p>

<p>“While you were crystal-gazing you mumbled something
about your idea of aristocracy and business efficiency.”</p>

<p>“Oh, did I? It’s simply that an aristocracy, freed from
the necessity of work, that is, free to seek pleasure, is necessary
if we are to have any <span class="lock">culture—</span>any civilization higher
than a factory civilization.”</p>

<p>“Then you’d have to have a class that works and another
class that lives on the fruits of their labor.”</p>

<p>“Exactly.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span></p>

<p>“Now I understand your attitude toward the Negro.
You’d have them slaves.”</p>

<p>“Slaves, servants or <span class="lock">laborers—</span>in their definite <span class="lock">place—</span>it
doesn’t matter. And a cultured, leisure class instead of
the efficient business man. But that isn’t what we’re here
<span class="lock">for—</span>to discuss sociology. I want to know more about you.
This may be our last time together.”</p>

<p>He leaned across the table, conscious that his hands were
moving toward hers across the cloth. But he stopped them.</p>

<p>“You know I’m going to rejoin my regiment Monday.
Another month in barracks and then I’ll be sailing back.”</p>

<p>They rose, Hamilton helped her into her cloak, paid his
pour boire to the waiter and picked up his check.</p>

<p>“They’re not so inefficient,” he said, glancing at the
figures.</p>

<p>“Who? The French?”</p>

<p>“Yes, they put a half dozen hors d’œuvres on the table
that aren’t on the menu and charge you for the whole plate
if you take just a single radish or olive or whatever it is.
Well, c’est la guerre. Poor devils, they need it.”</p>

<p>They were walking down the magnificent Rue Soufflet,
Hamilton immersed in thought, Meadows keeping up the
burden of conversation. At the corner of Rue de St.
Jacques, Meadows pointed out the bronze tablet of the old
Porte St. Jacques and for a moment they paused to decipher
it. Between the Parthenon, which glittered from an eminence
to the east and Boulevard St. Michel ahead, crowds
of students were walking leisurely arm in arm, arguing,
gesticulating, singing. Men with beards and boyish faces,
voluptuous velvet hats; thin, threadbare coats. There were
pale young men, with negligent clothing and an air of being
mildly intoxicated. Over the buildings to the north rose
the towers of the Sorbonne.</p>

<p>The students formed a <span class="lock">background—</span>a restless current,
sparkling, gay, animated, against which moved other figures;
girls in gay clothes, coats to their knees, bobbed hair,
stopping to flirt; men of affairs hurrying to the boulevard;
officers, including a score of foreigners doing the Latin
Quartier. Crippled soldiers. On the road the stream of
taxis and motor cars.</p>

<p>Meadows’ blue cloak made a daub of color in the picture
and Hamilton’s quick eyes noted it. He was thinking how
well she fitted into his brief world here. He was wondering
how she would fit into life in New <span class="lock">York—</span>or Corinth.
And again he compared her with that other figure. He
wished it were Spring.</p>

<p>A man and woman went by, their arms around each
other, unmindful of the <span class="lock">world—</span>a man with long hair and
a silky beard, meanly dressed, without gloves; a frail
blonde with high run-down heels and torn gloves. But
their eyes shone. Hamilton envied them.</p>

<p>They crossed the Boulevard St. Michel and entered the
Luxembourg Gardens. There were other couples walking
about, examining the statuary and sitting on the benches.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
Some were making love openly; others more subtly. Near
a bronze statue of a fawn sat a one-legged soldier and his
wife. They were holding hands and looking before them
vacantly. A boy of four in a soldier’s suit stood watching
them gravely. There were other soldiers, many of them
crippled.</p>

<p>Hamilton was acutely conscious of the shortness of the
day. A few more hours and it would be over. Then, farewell
to Paris and Meadows. He was falling into a sentimental
mood. He wondered whether he should tell her of
his engagement to Margaret. Probably she had guessed it.
At any rate, he decided, there was no occasion for his mentioning
it now.</p>

<p>Near the Fontaine de Medicis they found a bench
thoughtfully hidden from the walk by shrubbery. They
sat down and suddenly looked into each other’s eyes. The
sun was falling in a stream across her hair and a coquettish
puff of wind was toying with a loosened strand. They were
so close now that the end touched his cheek. He leaned
over, his heart pounding, while his hand found hers. But
she lowered her head, turned it to one side and looked away.</p>

<p>He remained holding her hand and presently she looked
up. They went on talking, rapidly, lightly, neither understanding
what they were saying, conscious of only one
thing, and determined not to acknowledge its presence. To
acknowledge it would mean to stifle it.</p>

<p>How had this happened? He had simply meant to say
good-bye to <span class="lock">Dorothy—</span>that is, to Meadows. He owed her
much for her kindness in the hospital. That was all. And
here he was holding her hand. It was too late to withdraw
his hand. He must wait until she took hers away. But
probably she was unconscious that they were holding hands.
Women sometimes were like that. Or, perhaps, it had no
special meaning to her. Other persons were doing it and
thinking nothing of it, couples probably even less intimate
than they.</p>

<p>“And I suppose you’ll be seeing that girl in Corinth,”
Meadows was saying.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, of course.” Hamilton didn’t know how the talk
had drifted to her.</p>

<p>“Does she know you’ve been wounded?”</p>

<p>Hamilton did not wish to talk about Margaret, but he
answered, “Yes and no. That is, I wrote her that I had
been slightly scratched by a piece of shell. She doesn’t
know how serious it’s been. I was afraid it might give
her a shock. She’s such a child. It’s really nothing to
worry about, although Dr. Levin said I must take things
easy, for a time at least.”</p>

<p>“Poor, brave boy,” said Meadows, shaking her head
slowly.</p>

<p>“I suppose it’s my contribution to settling the great war.
But you’ve given more, infinitely more, for a woman.”</p>

<p>“Oh, only about two years that I might have spent in
dancing, attending teas and receptions, playing the society
<span class="lock">girl—</span>and I haven’t missed all the receptions, either. It’s
all been very <span class="lock">fascinating—</span>and hard. I got into the work
before we declared <span class="lock">war—</span>that is before we declared that
a state of war existed.”</p>

<p>“How did you happen to join the Red Cross? You’re
not a professional nurse, are you? It must have taken a
lot of pluck.”</p>

<p>“I’m almost a graduate, six months from being one.
You have to be, you know. But I’m not a professional
nurse in the sense that I expect to earn a living at it. You
see, I’ve always had a hobby for social service. But when
I was studying sociology in college I found that the trouble
with the professional sociologists is that they lack technical
training. They can make fine reports, but when it comes
to showing a mother of six children how to care for a
sick child, they fall down. One has to know more, in a
practical way, than the manual of home nursing offers.</p>

<p>“I want to be able to go into a home and show a woman
how to bathe the babies, how to prepare the bottles, how
to make the beds and wash diapers quicker. It’s hardly
an aristocratic conception, you see. There are a hundred
things like that I’ve learned by nursing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span></p>

<p>“But when did you have time for all this?” Hamilton
looked puzzled. “Two and a half years in training, two
years over here, and a college course. You look like a
college junior.”</p>

<p>Meadows blushed. “I’m older than you think, perhaps.
But I used to be something of a child prodigy. I was
fifteen when I graduated from high school and I did college
in three years. So, you see, I’m not hopelessly old yet.”</p>

<p>“And when you get back?”</p>

<p>“Oh, there’s so much to do. Father and mother were
shocked when I took up nursing and again when I left for
France. But I think they’ve become reconciled. You see
they expected me to fit smoothly into their little social
scheme.”</p>

<p>Meadows sketched her career with illuminating, humorous
sidelights.</p>

<p>Her first revolt had come when she insisted on entering
the University of Wisconsin instead of an Eastern girls’
college and had elected to major in sociology, with economics
as her minor. Shock two came when she turned down
the bid of the <span class="lock">Kappas—</span>at that particular time the most
desirable <span class="lock">sorority—</span>and denounced fraternities and sororities
for their snobbishness before her “lit” society. Then
she had joined the students’ Socialist society, taken part
in organizing a daily newspaper that would be free from
faculty control, and joined the staff of a monthly magazine,
started in opposition to the Literary Magazine, for the purpose
of supporting free verse, modernist literature and art
and, principally, of poking fun at the conservatism of the
professors.</p>

<p>“Of course, I’ve gotten over most of my enthusiasms,”
she laughed. “It was simply a stage in my growth. But
I’m still pretty radical, I guess, for my <span class="lock">people—</span>and for
you. I’m not even a Socialist now, although at one time
I was on the verge of anarchism and used to hear Emma
Goldman every time she came to Madison. But, at least,
I am a liberal.”</p>

<p>She suddenly broke off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span></p>

<p>“But, of course, this doesn’t interest you. You’re probably
wondering whether I’ve spoiled my complexion by
going in for all these things instead of taking vocal lessons
<span class="lock">and—</span>I was going to say <span class="lock">French—</span>but I’ve learned French
at that. I’ll bet you’re wondering right now more how I
managed to get through school so young without wearing
glasses and looking like a freak.”</p>

<p>Hamilton started. It was exactly what he had been
thinking.</p>

<p>He had been watching her lips and eyes as much as
attending to her words. It was a dangerous game, he knew,
but he was being carried along by a tide stronger than
he could stem. Suddenly a bell tinkled, announcing the
closing of the gates. It was growing dusk. Hamilton bent
down and kissed her. She lifted her arms and raised her
lips to his, and for as long as one can hold one’s breath
they remained thus.</p>

<p>Arm in arm, they retraced their steps through the gardens
of the Luxembourg. Other couples were walking similarly,
singing, laughing. Through the gathering gray, lights were
twinkling on the boulevard. They walked in silence. There
were tears on her lashes.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XI"><abbr title="Eleven">XI</abbr></h2>
</div>

<p>Hamilton did not see Dorothy again before leaving
France, although he sent her a short note from camp
announcing the good news. For on their return to their
regiment, both Hamilton and McCall had found orders
promoting them to captaincies. In reply Dorothy sent a
note of congratulation.</p>

<p>To Margaret, Hamilton sent a longer letter and another
to his parents. He was beginning to feel ashamed of his
display of emotion toward <span class="lock">Dorothy—</span>ashamed and perplexed.
He meant to marry Margaret as soon as he returned
to America and he knew that the first principle of
any system of ethics was <span class="lock">fidelity—</span>fidelity to one’s country,
to one’s church, to the woman of one’s choice. Dorothy
merely had interested him. True he had much for which
he would always be deeply grateful to her. Yet there could
be nothing more than friendship between them.</p>

<p>He did not even know <span class="lock">Dorothy—</span>had spoken to her intimately
only twice. He had no idea whether her peculiar
fascination for him would survive more frequent meetings,
whether their brief friendship was anything more than a
passing fancy. Why then had he kissed her?—if he really
had kissed her. Sometimes it seemed like part of a dream.</p>

<p>Still, other men did it. One of the majors in the regiment,
a married man, was always bragging about his
exploits, not merely kissing episodes. Yet he continually
referred to “the wife and kiddies” and expressed his longing
for them. There might be an exception here and there,
but practically every officer in the regiment practiced and
preached the creed: “What they don’t know”—“they”
referring to wives, fiancées and sweethearts—“won’t hurt
’em.” In civil life, Hamilton recalled, it had been the
same.</p>

<p>Margaret was so obviously the woman intended for him.
She had beauty, youth, the social graces and an assured<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
social position. She would make an ideal wife and mother
and grace any home. They had always moved in the same
social circles; his friends were her friends. Their social
conventions were the same. There would be no barriers
to break down, no lessons to learn.</p>

<p>But after all a man didn’t love that way. One didn’t
reason about such things. He loved <span class="lock">her—</span>just because he
loved her. And he really did love Margaret. He had loved
her when he was still in knickerbockers. He had loved her
when he was going to prep school. He had loved her all
those years in Harvard and since then.</p>

<p>Yet, in spite of this, Hamilton wondered whether he
would now be engaged if it had not been for the sentimentalism
attendant on leaving America to fight and possibly
to die. He wondered whether she would have come
to camp at the time when he was most susceptible, if she
had not thought it a duty. Sometimes one’s motives were
very complex. She had come because she thought it her
duty to give him the opportunity to ask for all that she
could <span class="lock">give—</span>her promise to marry him. And knowing why
she had come, he had proposed out of a sense of gallantry.
If he had not asked her it would be equivalent to jilting
her.</p>

<p>But what difference did that make? He would have
proposed to her eventually, anyway. In the end he would
marry her.</p>

<p>The officers spent most of their time on board the
Mauretania homeward bound in playing cards. It was
early in March and still cold and foggy on deck.</p>

<p>“What’s worrying you?” said McCall to Hamilton, one
night over the card table, after the other players had turned
in for the night. McCall was dealing out “cold” hands
as a fitting conclusion to the evening’s play. The cabin
was thick with smoke.</p>

<p>“Worrying me?” Hamilton’s brows went up. “Nothing
at all. I’m going to beat you again. Come on, deal me
that king.”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t mean that. I mean something else.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span></p>

<p>“Why, do I look downhearted?”</p>

<p>“Sometimes, a little. Perhaps it’s my imagination. Perhaps
it’s the getting back, the uncertainty. Sometimes I
feel it. I wonder how I’ll be able to get back into the old
life. I wonder if I’ll fit in.”</p>

<p>Hamilton laughed.</p>

<p>“I’ll fit in beautifully. I’ll sleep until noon every day
for a year. I’ll take three baths a <span class="lock">day—</span>steam baths, cold
baths, stingy shower baths. The rest of the day I’ll lie
around the house in my most disreputable clothes, reading
and sleeping.”</p>

<p>McCall stopped dealing the cards and leaned back in his
chair. “Well, I won’t get up for any reveille, Hamilton,
but I’m going to work when I get back.”</p>

<p>“Going to write the great American novel?”</p>

<p>“Oh, something like that. There’s one thing I’ve got
out of the war. A <span class="lock">theme—</span>a thumping big theme for a
novel. It’s the sense of our national unity. Before the
war there used to be talk about America being a conglomeration
of races. This war has proved for all time that
we are a real nation, a single people, united so strongly
by an ideal that we have been able to sacrifice everything
in a common war with an enemy separated from us by
three thousand miles of water. What other nation can show
such a record?</p>

<p>“France was fighting for her life. Naturally she was
united. Germany for an extension of her trade. England
to oppose it and protect her own. Belgium had been
invaded. Russia was afraid of losing her interest in the
Balkans. All the other countries had economic or political
interests one way or the other, and in the end they were
fighting for their lives.</p>

<p>“But we had absolutely nothing tangible to fight <span class="lock">for—</span>nothing
but an ideal, or set of ideals. Making the world
safe for democracy may seem too simple a formula to
explain the complex political and economic motives for our
entering the war, but it was true in the main. As far as
the soldiers were concerned, that’s exactly what they were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
fighting <span class="lock">for—</span>what we used to tell them at training camp.
You didn’t find any difference in the courage or loyalty
of your men, simply because of their parentage, did you?”</p>

<p>Hamilton considered.</p>

<p>“No. I don’t think so. I haven’t really thought it out.
There might be an advantage in favor of one nationality
or <span class="lock">another—</span>but it would probably be small. Of course, we
got most of the lower east side element in our companies,
a lot of little sweat-shop tailors, Jews. Most of them had
probably never seen a rifle before in their lives. But they
turned out surprisingly well. They’ve got intelligence.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s this feeling of national unity I want to express.
This unity we used to talk about in the training <span class="lock">camps—</span>that
we used to instill into the men with their bayonet
drill and manual of arms. This unity of America’s children,
regardless of race or creed.”</p>

</div>

<p>For a moment they were silent. It was Hamilton who
broke the silence.</p>

<p>“I’ve been feeling the same thing,” he said. “You know
I’ve been brought up in the South. Ancestors lived in
Georgia before Oglethorpe and all that.”</p>

<p>He waved his arm expressively. “And I suppose I’ve
been something of a snob. All through the war I got to
realizing it. But old ideas die hard. Take Williams, for
instance, the nigger that saved my life. I wanted to thank
him and yet I couldn’t. Something stuck in my throat. It
was the same way when I saw him at the reception. I
couldn’t stand seeing him there on a par with white men.
It was the way I’d been brought up, I guess. Grandfather
owned a hundred slaves.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe in social equality for the negro. I think
the white man was destined to rule and the black to be
<span class="lock">ruled—</span>don’t <span class="lock">interrupt—</span>still I’ve begun to see that the white
man, we rulers, haven’t been doing the fair thing by the
black. I wasn’t fair to Williams, and the South isn’t fair
to its millions of Williams. We deprive them of an education,
we don’t give them a fair trial in our courts. We
don’t let them vote.</p>

<p>“It’s the same way with foreigners. I’ve been with them,
slept with them, eaten with them, fought with them. Under
the skin we’re all the same. The same elemental passions,
the same hopes and fears. Not so much difference in culture
as you’d think, except what’s due to difference in
education.”</p>

<p>Hamilton went on eagerly, often incoherently, while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
McCall nodded his head in approval.</p>

<p>“That’s the first time I’ve heard you talk like that,” he
put in. “What’s happened to you?”</p>

<p>Hamilton pondered. “I suppose I’ve been coming to it
<span class="lock">gradually—</span>and without realizing it. You know how those
things go. You advocate an idea and then for the sake of
consistency you keep advocating it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I understand. It’s what I always call ‘mental
inertia.’”</p>

<p>“Mental or moral inertia, that’s it. The inertia that one
has to overcome in order to change an <span class="lock">opinion—</span>the subconscious
prejudices and reactions, the fear of being
thought inconsistent, all that. When I first learned that
the universe had not been created in seven <span class="lock">days—</span>that is,
seven days of twenty-four hours <span class="lock">each—</span>I fought against it.
I didn’t want to believe it. A rational being would obviously
weigh the facts coldly and dispassionately and then arrive
at a conclusion. But it took me a long time to accept the
fact that the earth is millions of years old.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s the way with all new ideas,” McCall fished
a cigarette box out of his pocket, passed it over to Hamilton
and selected a cigarette himself. “Hand me the matches.
Nobody wants a new idea, until it’s forced on him, including,
of course, Christianity. The man with a new <span class="lock">idea—</span>whether
it’s a new religious philosophy, a new system
of government, a new way of painting, a new way of
writing, a new <span class="lock">invention—</span>is hooted down in the church,
the school or the market-place. About the best thing that
can happen to any innovator is to die of hunger in an attic.
You know that old saw about building a better mouse trap
and the world will beat a path to your door. Emerson was
all wrong. Now if you take a standard, common, ordinary
mouse trap and open a stand on Fifth Avenue and Broadway
or on State and Madison Streets and advertise Hamilton
Mouse Traps consistently, you will get the world to use
them. But, believe me, if you retreat to a wood and spend
twenty years in studying the weaknesses of mice and inventing
an entirely new trap for their ensnarement, you will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
stick in that same wood until travelers find your body
devoured by the squirrels. Nobody will buy your better
mouse trap. Why? Simply because it’s a different kind
of mouse trap than anyone has used <span class="lock">before—</span>unless you
spend time and effort showing him that it is better.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I suppose we’re all like that. We hate change.
Our engineers study means of reducing friction, overcoming
inertia, when the most important inertia is in our
minds.”</p>

<p>They paused and remained silent for a moment, puffing
reflectively on their cigarettes.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what has set me thinking,” said Hamilton
at length, laying his cigarette down. “No, thanks, no more.
Some one I met in Paris. Of course, all this time, all
these two years, my ideas had been changing gradually.
Did you ever study physics? You know how it is when
you have a salt in solution and you try to crystallize it; you
have the proper solution, the temperature is correct, but
nothing happens until you give it a little jar. I suppose
that jar offsets some sort of <span class="lock">inertia—</span>the inertia of form.</p>

<p>“Well, my jar came by my contact with some one. All
the time my ideas had been changing subconsciously. I
had been piling up new impressions. But I still continued
to reason along old lines. Then I came in contact with
some one who had given up a life <span class="lock">of—</span>well, the sort of life
I had <span class="lock">planned—</span>for one of service. I’ve always been an
egoist. I’ve always sneered at reformers and idealists. But
here was a person whose motives were so obviously different
from anything I had ever encountered that my mind
was jarred. I didn’t know it at the time. I wonder how
many revelations are discovered after they actually take
place? It sounds like a paradox.”</p>

<p>“Aha, so another woman has come into your life!” McCall
grinned and lit a fresh cigarette.</p>

<p>“Woman?”</p>

<p>“Certainly! She’s given you this little <span class="lock">jar—</span>set you
thinking.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t say it was a woman.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span></p>

<p>“But you didn’t say it wasn’t. Which amounts to the
same thing. If it had been a man you would have said
Major Jinks, or Dr. Levin, or Peter Smith or whoever it
was. You wouldn’t say ‘some one’ all the time.”</p>

<p>“You <em>are</em> right,” said Hamilton, at length. “Let’s open
a door and get some of this smoke out before we turn in.
Miss Meadows has set me thinking. But you know what
I think—”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“I’m going down to Corinth first thing and get married.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m not surprised. You’ve been engaged long
enough. Ever since we were at Camp Mills. Best of luck,
old man.”</p>

<p>Hamilton was disappointed. He had thought that the
announcement would surprise McCall. It had surprised
himself. He had suddenly expressed his intention aloud.
Was it to commit himself to making a decision? He was
in love with Margaret. He wished to be united with her
irrevocably. He wished that there be no doubt in his mind
about it. There really was no reason, after all, why McCall
should be surprised. He had expected it right along.
Hamilton wondered why he should wish to pledge himself
to marry Margaret, and why he should take this means of
proclaiming his intention. He wondered whether McCall
would think it odd, or whether he thought about it at all.</p>

<p>“Well, two more days and we’ll see land,” said McCall,
as he hopped into bed. “Just think, one more night after
this, then home again! No more reveille. No more trenches.
No more slumgullion. No more rain. Whee! We really
<em>ought</em> to get drunk!” Hamilton agreed and slowly prepared
for bed.</p>

<p>There was much drinking the next night, Hamilton
acquitting himself like a <span class="lock">gentleman—</span>that is, imbibing large
quantities without perceptible <span class="lock">effect—</span>and McCall like a
zealot.</p>

<p>“Ought to get drunk. Ought to get drunk.” McCall
kept repeating. “Last chance on the bounding, boundless
Atlantic.”</p>

<p>McCall went on explaining his philosophy of intoxication
between swallows.</p>

<p>“This is occasion that demands intoxication,” he said.
“Demands intoxication, like poet demands fine frenzy with
his eye rolling between heaven and earth and hell, or something.</p>

<p>“When you’re not drunk, Hamilton, you’re bundled with
<span class="lock">clothes—</span>pants, shoes, coat, fur coat, gloves, silk hat.
They’re your conventions, your inhibitions, your <span class="lock">prohibitions—</span>hooray
for Bryan! You can’t embrace occasion
with clothes <span class="lock">on—</span>shoes, hats, coats, overcoat, pants. Got
to get rid of ’em, boys, got to get rid of ’em! Civilized
man’s got too many clothes. How’s he going to do it?
How’s he going to do it, boys?”</p>

<p>McCall went gravely from one to the other, repeating
his question. Nobody was listening. Every one was laughing
extravagantly, except the sentimental major, who was
weeping over his wife and kiddies. A captain and a second
lieutenant were trying vainly to comfort him. Two
captains were telling funny stories at the same time. Another
group was singing songs. Hamilton was laughing
loudly at all of them because he was the only man sober.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you how to get rid of your clothes,” McCall held
up a whiskey bottle and waxed oratorical. “Civilized man
got solution right here, in little bottle with removable cork.
Get drunk! Then all conventions, all restraints disappear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
like the dew before a midday sun, like dew on desert’s
dusty face, like <span class="lock">dew—</span>well, anyway like dew!</p>

<p>“When you’re drunk, you’re free. You’re free like
gilded bird let out of cage, or bird out of gilded cage.
Your mind is free. Your soul is free of its trammels.
Who wants to wear trammels anyway? Down with trammels.
The fetters on your <span class="lock">mind—</span>the restraints, the conventions
are removed like buttons from pair trousers. One
drink and you remove the yoke from your neck.”</p>

<p>He unbuttoned his blouse, untied the white collar about
his neck and flung it to the floor.</p>

<p>“You remove strait-jacket of liberties.”</p>

<p>He wriggled out of his tight coat and flung it on one of
the berths.</p>

<p>“You remove shirt of Nessus.”</p>

<p>Swish, his shirt came off.</p>

<p>“You practice sabotage against moralities.”</p>

<p>His putties and shoes went clattering on the floor.</p>

<p>“Now look at me. A free man. A symbol of released
spirit. A <span class="lock">symbol—</span>I say I’m a symbol. Listen to me
<span class="lock">syming—</span>sym; sym, sym, sym, sym.”</p>

<p>He began beating a rhythm against the table with his
bottle.</p>

<p>“I’m a symbol—”</p>

<p>“He’s a dumb-bell!” some one else shouted. “Put some
clothes on the idiot.”</p>

<p>The next minute the symbol of man’s freedom from
restrictions was being wrapped in a blanket and deposited
in a berth, still protesting, in a voice growing feebler and
feebler, his symbolism by a series of sym, sym, syms.</p>

<p>A few hours later, Hamilton was standing at the bow of
the ocean liner, drinking in deep draughts of the cool air
and peering through the gray fog. Far away, on the
horizon, the cloud seemed blacker. The sun was just beginning
to rise in the vessel’s wake, throwing huge shadows
ahead. All about him other men were peering through the
mist. There was an air of excitement, of eagerness and of
expectation. There was a subdued buzz of conversation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
through which brisk orders and the bustle of the sailors
sounded. As it grew lighter, Hamilton saw men crowding
the rails, in life-boats, swarming along the rigging, everywhere.
It was vain to try to keep the land men in their
place. There were heads at every port hole.</p>

<p>Hamilton’s eyes had become tired from peering into the
west and from lack of sleep and he had fallen into a sort of
doze. Battle scenes, pictures of Margaret, the hospital,
training camp, were jumbled in his brain. He was happy
and yet vaguely dissatisfied. He wondered whether any
one would be at the pier to meet him. He wondered
whether Margaret would be there and what she would say
when they met. Would his father be there?</p>

<p>He wondered whether he would ever see Dorothy again.
The unit to which Dorothy belonged had returned to America
three weeks ago. Dr. Levin had returned on the same
ship and, undoubtedly by this time, had gotten his discharge.
Before leaving he had written Hamilton, telling him that
he meant to spend a few weeks in New York before returning
to Chicago. He had given his address at a hotel on
Fifth Avenue, near Central Park, and had urged Hamilton
and McCall to visit him there at their first opportunity. It
would be good to see him again, perhaps spend a night or
two together, as they had in Paris.</p>

<p>Hamilton aroused himself. The sun was growing
warmer and brighter <span class="lock">and—</span>suddenly on the horizon, still
far away, loomed New <span class="lock">York—</span>a shadowy mass out of which
tall, slender towers aspired to the sky. Glittering Gothic
cathedrals of a race of giants. Gigantic fairy palaces. And
there, gleaming in the morning sunlight, a symbolic figure
with torch extended.</p>

<p>Hamilton had come home again. Home to the land of
Liberty, home to the land which had given lavishly of its
treasure, of its very flesh and blood to bring a new conception
of liberty and democracy to the old world. A
fresh, strong, triumphant country, throwing spires of steel
and huge smoke-stacks into the air, spanning rivers, tunnelling
through mountains, girding waterfalls, building<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
cities and binding them by bands of steel. The young giant
among nations, deep-chested, long-limbed, athletic; the
clean-minded, hard-fisted champion of democracy. The
champion of down-trodden races and peoples. The one
nation without a selfish claim at the peace conference.
Hamilton felt proud that he was an American.</p>

<p>The morning dragged in routine. <span class="lock">Tasks—</span>roll calls, sick
reports, personnel reports, final inspections. Hamilton
made a little speech to his men, cautioning them to behave
as soldiers even though they had returned, emphasizing certain
instructions in regard to <span class="lock">debarkation—</span>the order in
which they were to leave, how they were to entrain, and
so forth. But principally he thanked them for their loyalty
and expressed the conviction that they would continue to
practise the lessons that they had all learned in the <span class="lock">war—</span>himself
included, the unity of the nation, its strength,
physical and moral, because it was a nation composed of
many different human elements. A nation where each man
was a citizen like any other man in spite of differences in
race, color and religion.</p>

<p>At the close of his talk, a little Jewish corporal came up
to him, saluted and asked timidly if he could shake his
hand. Hamilton extended his hand with a smile.</p>

<p>“You know, captain,” the corporal’s eyes blinked with
happiness, “I absolutely didn’t know it was in you. I
thought, you’ll pardon me, captain, you was a damn fine
officer, but a stuck-upper. Now, I see my mistake. It was
all the time you was playing a game <span class="lock">like—</span>so we’d be better
soldiers.”</p>

<p>Emboldened by the corporal, an Italian, who ran a fruit
stand two years ago, came up and shook hands warmly.</p>

<p>“Eet is vairy fine,” he said in his broken English. “That
feeling you express. I feel it too, down here. We one,
big, fine people. We all fight togaither. No wop. No dago.
All Americains now!”</p>

<p>Hamilton gulped.</p>

<p>“That’s exactly so, Marco. We’re all Americans. We’ve
all earned the right to be called that now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span></p>

<p>He looked about at the other men. Some were too
bashful to come forward. They stood back, with something
like awe and gladness in their eyes. Others crowded
around him in little groups. Here was a Greek, who had
left a shoe shine stand to enter the war, and had been cited
twice for bravery. Here was a Slav, who had probably dug
ditches since coming to America and, in spite of the difficulties
of mastering a foreign language, had become a corporal.
Here was an Essex street tailor who had won the
Croix de Guerre.</p>

<p>He studied their faces. They were the faces of men who
had always worked hard, mostly with their hands, and who
still had met the test on the field of battle, in the gentleman’s
job of fighting.</p>

<p>Here was a German baker, a Hungarian waiter, a Polish
truck driver. Here were Gentiles and Jews, Protestants
and Catholics; a few men from northern Europe, blue eyed,
with long skulls; some Slavs with high cheek bones and
round heads; but mostly brown-eyed men from southern
Europe, and Jews. Men of the east side of New <span class="lock">York—</span>unskilled
laborers, clerks, milk-wagon drivers, elevator
operators. Men from all the uninteresting and useful occupations
of New York.</p>

<p>The last task had been done, the men were dressed and
packed and excitedly crowding every available spot on the
ship from which they could see land. The ship rocked with
shouts and cheers. Men were singing songs about their
companies and cities; sentimental songs, marching songs.
Jokes flew back and forth. College yells, modified to suit
States and regiments, rose. Cheers for individual officers.
Hamilton heard a three times three for him that sounded
familiarly like the yell the bleachers had given him the
day he was carried off the field with the broken nose.</p>

<p>They had passed quarantine and were being tugged up
the Hudson, with a score of smaller <span class="lock">boats—</span>tugs and
launches draped in <span class="lock">bunting—</span>forming an escort. On the
boats were huge canvas and cardboard signs of welcome.
On the decks of the welcoming ships, along the shore, from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
every window and on the roofs of the towering skyscrapers
thousands of men, women and children were waving bright
flags and banners, throwing clouds of confetti and serpentines
of paper. Gay flags and strips of bunting flamed
from the buildings.</p>

<p>The band on the Mauretania struck up a tune. Bands
on the shores played. Whistles and sirens screamed, bells
rang. Voices shouted songs and words of welcome. The
mingled sounds rose and fell in tremendous surges. It
was New York’s welcome.</p>

<p>On the tugs men were shouting through megaphones:
“Is Jack Butler, of Company E, there? His mother welcomes
him.” “Hello Bill!” The men on the ship shouted
their answers in chorus.</p>

<p>“Is Dick Blackwell on board?” This time there was no
answer. The men looked at each other, their faces suddenly
red. Dick was not on board. He had made the
supreme sacrifice and now lay on the field of glory somewhere
in France.</p>

<p>His name had appeared on the casualty list, but someone
had refused to believe it until the last.</p>

<p>Now they had passed the Battery and its cheering thousands
and were being swung about to the pier in Hoboken.
On the Jersey <span class="lock">shore—</span>new bands of music, new flags and
banners, new thousands of waving, exultant human beings.</p>

<p>The band strikes up “Home, Sweet Home”; cheering,
laughing and singing suddenly die down. A new look of
wistfulness steals into the men’s eyes. No one trusts himself
to look at his neighbor. There is a murmur of suppressed
sobbing. The ecstacy of a common happiness is
gone. Each is carried to his own little world of memory,
of joy or sorrow. But the next minute the band is blaring
out “How Dry I Am,” and everyone is laughing, cheering
and beginning to sing uproariously. A few minutes later
the ship touches the side of the pier. They are back again.
It is noon.</p>

<p>Hamilton was watching the reception committee coming
on <span class="lock">board—</span>first the general in charge of the port of debarkation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
a magnificent but pathetic figure (he had made many
fruitless efforts to be sent overseas, but had always been
turned down because of age or some other unknown reason).
Beside him walked the mayor of New York, all
smiles. Then a group of <span class="lock">officers—</span>generals and colonels.
Next, other city and state officials. Then a delegation of
congressmen and prominent citizens and, suddenly, among
them, Hamilton’s <span class="lock">father—</span>a tall, slender man in the fifties,
with aristocratic iron-gray hair and blue eyes, arched brows,
gray moustache and goatee. A little thinner and paler than
he had appeared two years ago, Hamilton thought in that
first whirl of oversweeping emotions.</p>

<p>He longed to cry out to his father, but instead he stood
peering over the rail motionless. A hundred questions
rushed into his <span class="lock">mind—</span>questions about his old life, about
his father’s health, about his mother, about the home, about
the servants, about persons he had known. Would he appear
changed to his father? A flood of old emotions, associations
long forgotten, vague anxieties, swept over him.</p>

<p>He felt strangely aloof, far away, a stranger among
familiar things, one returned to a once familiar land that has
somehow become foreign.</p>

<p>Suddenly he was a child again, with an absurd wish to
<span class="lock">cry—</span>in spite of the cheers and songs and band music all
about him. He had started to run away from Corinth on
his white pony, became frightened and homesick and galloped
back home to fling himself into his father’s arms.</p>

<p>The next moment Robert was elbowing his way to the
companionway and down the stairs.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XIII"><abbr title="Thirteen">XIII</abbr></h2>
</div>

<p>It was the second week of their stay at Camp Mills.
Robert’s father had returned to Corinth on the third day
after the return of the troops. He had come with the idea
of bringing Robert home with him, having forgotten in his
enthusiasm that the troops would first have to be discharged.
Father and son had spent an evening in New York, dining
together at the hotel, strolling leisurely down Fifth Avenue,
visiting several cafés, principally talking. There were a
thousand questions to ask and a thousand answers to make.</p>

<p>Hamilton was packing things into a wooden box, when
McCall came running into the room.</p>

<p>“What’re you doing?” asked McCall. “Want a hand?
Oh, I see, packing away the relics of the World War to
show your children and your children’s children.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” said Hamilton, wiping his brow with his
sleeve. “Hand me that gas mask! That’s it. Now for the
books. Some I had with me. The rest I picked up in Paris.”</p>

<p>“What’s the idea of packing now? You don’t expect to
get out so soon, do you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I might as well do it now. Get it over with. All
right, now give me that hammer.”</p>

<p>“Have you seen the new order?” asked McCall. “What do
you think of applying for appointment to the regular army?”</p>

<p>“Do I look crazy?” He savagely hammered the last nail
into position and arose. “Now, that’s over.”</p>

<p>“But there are some fellows who have applied.” McCall
stretched himself on the bunk and hunched up his knees
comfortably. “There’s McMasters and Dowling. And
I’ve been undecided about it.”</p>

<p>“What? I thought you were going to write a novel or
something. Going to get down to work.”</p>

<p>“Now that it’s so near I’m getting cold feet. I don’t
know if I can work. That is, do civilian work. Write any
more. You know how blamed thick competition is on a
newspaper anyway. I don’t know if I could hold a job.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
Oh, I suppose I could, but in the army there’s no uncertainty.
As long as the government lasts you draw your
pay check.”</p>

<p>“Of all the idiots, McCall, you’re the biggest. You’ve
been working too hard on your service records. What do
you say to breaking away tonight? We can catch the five
o’clock train and get to New York in time to look up Levin.
I’ve got his address you know, and the old bird will be
glad to see us.”</p>

<p>“All right. All right. We’ve got almost an hour yet.
I’ll get dressed and call for you and we can check out
together.”</p>

<p>McCall lit a cigarette, puffed silently for a few minutes
and left.</p>

<p>When a voice over the telephone announced that it was
General Pershing talking and wanting to know why the
devil he hadn’t turned in all his Hinkle pills and iodine, and
wanting to know where the devil all the spiritus frumenti
had disappeared to, Dr. Levin immediately recognized that
it was McCall.</p>

<p>“All right, general,” he said, “as soon as I get through
prescribing some pills for Marshall Foch. Where are you?
In the lobby? Hamilton with you? Fine. Come right up,
general.”</p>

<p>Hamilton and McCall burst into the room two minutes
later and found a changed <span class="lock">Levin—</span>a Levin in civilian
clothes, surprisingly dignified and taller than they had
remembered.</p>

<p>“Don’t stare,” said Levin genially. “It’s just my clothes.
I never could wear a uniform. How in the world have
you been?”</p>

<p>They shook hands warmly, exchanged greetings and then
found seats on the bed. There was a cheerful exchange of
cigarettes and questions and exclamations of how glad they
were to be back.</p>

<p>“I wish you’d examine McCall’s cranium,” said Hamilton,
blowing a smoke wreath toward the ceiling, as he lay
back on the bed. “He’s talking about entering the regular
army, pardon me, the regular establishment.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, I was just thinking about it. Nothing certain,” said
McCall.</p>

<p>“One would think,” remarked Dr. Levin, rubbing a
thoughtful hand over his chin. “One would think that your
experiences in the World War would be a sufficient antidote.
But—”</p>

<p>His brows wrinkled. “How can you? I mean physically.
You couldn’t pass the examination.”</p>

<p>“I thought they’d let me in because I’d been wounded
in the war. Give me a staff job or something. I’ve got a
pretty good record, you know. Got the Croix de Guerre
and the Distinguished Service Cross. <span class="lock">But—</span>oh, well, I
didn’t really intend to apply for a commission in the regular
army. Just putting off making a decision as to what
I’m going to do when I get out. If you apply, they keep
you in longer.”</p>

<p>Dr. Levin chucked a pillow at McCall, and Hamilton,
following the cue, rumpled his hair.</p>

<p>“What are we going to do with this gloom?” Dr. Levin
appealed. “Let’s take him out and show him the city.”</p>

<p>McCall laughed. “I’m not gloomy. Just thirsty. Let’s go!”</p>

<p>“Just a minute,” laughed Dr. Levin. “I do things methodically.
Let’s draw up an itinerary. Where are we going?”</p>

<p>“What’s the difference where we go?” suggested McCall.
“The main thing is to go. We’ll charter a taxi and make
the rounds.”</p>

<p>“I think,” said Levin aside to Hamilton, as they were
pulling on their coats, “that something’s worrying McCall.
Has he a sweetheart in Paris?”</p>

<p>“Nonsense,” said Hamilton. “Wouldn’t he have told me?”</p>

<p>“Oh, of course, they always do, don’t they? Whenever
a man falls in love he runs around announcing the news.
Most of the time the man hasn’t any idea that he is in love.”</p>

<p>McCall, after flicking his shoes with a towel, joined them
and they started off together.</p>

<p>They began with the Little Club and champagne and
ended with Reisenwebers and gin fizzes.</p>

<p>With the first drink, McCall seemed to recover his spirits.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span></p>

<p>“On his third glass he usually begins to quote Walt
Whitman,” said Hamilton.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve seen many worse effects of drink,” Dr.
Levin’s eyes twinkled.</p>

<p>“But not much worse, eh?” said McCall. “Well, anyway,
I wish Whitman could take a look at this,” McCall
made a slight gesture with his hand. “I wonder what he’d
say about Manhattan and democracy.”</p>

<p>“I suppose we need a Whitman now,” said Dr. Levin.
“We’ve just gone through another Civil <span class="lock">War—</span>the Civil
War of the white race. It needs a poet, a Whitman to
sing the new ideal of democracy.”</p>

<p>“I think the war has brought about a new appreciation
of democracy,” said Hamilton.</p>

<p>“You’re right,” added McCall. “The war has put an
end to imperialism. The Kaiser is crushed. Germany is
a republic. The little countries of middle Europe are independent.
But especially to Russia do the real democrats of
the world turn their eyes. I think that even Great Britain will
have to give Ireland its freedom and relinquish its hold on
the oppressed brown <span class="lock">races—</span>the Hindus and the Persians.”</p>

<p>Dr. Levin shook his head. “You ought to be right, but
you aren’t. The war has set back democracy. Europe will
be split into fifty little states, all wrangling over boundary
lines, over seaports, over tariffs, over a hundred and one
things. Politically, Europe will be back in the middle ages,
while economically it is in the twentieth century.”</p>

<p>The crowning heresy to McCall and Hamilton came when
Levin proclaimed Bismarck a greater statesman than Wilson,
because he unified Europe, while Wilson divided it.</p>

<p>“At any rate,” said Hamilton at length, “we three are
united by a common love of our country and by certain
common ideals. We may not agree as to whether the war
has brought those ideals any closer to humanity or not,
although personally I think it has. But we do know that
these ideals are <span class="lock">ours—</span>America’s.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Levin, “and we are a little cross-section of
<span class="lock">America—</span>Catholic, Protestant and <span class="lock">Jew—</span>but an unusual
cross-section. Wait until you see the reaction in this country.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
The Italians are crying for Italia Irredenta and Italy
for the Italians. Poland is crying Poland for the Poles.
And the hundred per cent Americans have already begun
raising the same cry here. Of course, we’ve missed them
while we were in France; but the hundred per centers were
the men back home that kept the homefires of hatred <span class="lock">burning—</span>painting
yellow signs on German bakers who didn’t
invest a certain quota of their savings in Liberty bonds,
boycotting Hungarian restaurants, refusing to eat German
fried potatoes or listen to <span class="lock">Wagner—</span>stupid things like that.
But there were more important things, too, deprivation
of the right of free speech and assembly, and suppression
of newspapers.”</p>

<p>Hamilton remembered some of the letters Margaret had
written.</p>

<p>“Well, wasn’t it necessary to protect the country at home
from disaffection?”</p>

<p>“In certain cases it was, certainly,” said Levin. “But in
many <span class="lock">cases—</span>I won’t say ‘most,’ it wasn’t. That sort of
thing grows. It becomes a passion, a religion, like Sadism,
of inflicting punishment. Psychopathically it has an interesting
explanation. Politically it is dangerous. There is
no doubt that many persons derive keen pleasure in hurting
others. And the war has stirred them up.</p>

<p>“At first this intolerance is fairly <span class="lock">reasonable—</span>it makes
powerless the enemies of the government in the prosecution
of war. Which is as it should be. Then it becomes
ingrown. Instead of imprisoning traitors as they arise,
people begin to stir them up so that they may satisfy the
pleasure of imprisoning. Men begin to watch their neighbor
for slips from the patriotic code. A patriot must do
this thing and that and refrain from the other. There may
be five hundred different kinds of patriots in <span class="lock">actuality—</span>just
as we three represent three different points of view
and political philosophy. But the hundred per center can
understand only one <span class="lock">kind—</span>his own.</p>

<p>“He is a <span class="lock">Republican—</span>I am myself, by the <span class="lock">way—</span>so when
he finds an Anarchist he has him jugged. It makes no
difference whether he be a philosophic Anarchist, a follower<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
of Kropotkin, a man who is a vegetarian by principle
and has a Brahministic horror of shedding of <span class="lock">blood—</span>he is
placed in the same cell with the brute who was caught
placing a bomb under the railroad bridge. Socialists, Communists,
I. W. W.’s, sympathizers with the present Russian
<span class="lock">government—</span>all, in some way different from the hundred
per <span class="lock">centers—</span>are regarded as enemies of America. Even
liberals and progressives are viewed with suspicion.</p>

<p>“By January the country’s going dry. The same bigots
who have been denying the rights that the Constitution
guarantees every citizen in a misguided effort to protect
that Constitution, will be denouncing people who prefer to
drink cocktails instead of grape juice, as un-American.
Next it will be people who don’t belong to their race and
then, to their church.”</p>

<p>“No, never!” Hamilton interrupted. “This isn’t Russia.
America is too sensible.”</p>

<p>“I’m Russian by parentage, you know,” said Dr. Levin.
“The race riots there, the pogroms, were also supposed to
be patriotic. It was always the hundred per cent Russians
who incited the hooligans to riot. Imagine that! The
officials who were living corrupt lives, looting the public
treasury, depriving the soldiers and sailors of food and
ammunition to swell their own fortunes, those were the
ones who always cried Russia for the Russians. In the
name of patriotism they not only killed the Jews, but imprisoned,
exiled and killed the real patriots, who were working
for a republic. You see it always starts with patriotism.
And in Russia the idea of religion was mixed in with
it. Those who don’t believe as you do are not only enemies
of the state, but also of Christ. The victims of the plunderers
and murderers become anti-Christs. It’s ironic.”</p>

<p>“I think that’s just a wild dream of yours. But whatever
happens”—he raised a glass of champagne—“here’s
to our friendship, born of the war to make the world safe
for democracy.”</p>

<p>He proposed the toast jocularly, but it symbolized the
moment and they drank, almost seriously.</p>

<p>At the Century roof garden they sat back and watched
the spectacle critically.</p>

<p>“It hasn’t the verve of a Paris performance,” remarked
McCall.</p>

<p>“<span class="lock">Verve—</span>you mean nerve,” replied Hamilton. “But the
cocktails are there. Anyway, I like this better.”</p>

<p>“That’s because you’re a Puritan. In Paris you were
always being shocked by the exhibitions.” McCall winked
at Dr. Levin, who was listening with a smile on his face.</p>

<p>“Ah, yes, a Puritan who drinks cocktails. I don’t mind
an exhibition of legs, if they’re good <span class="lock">legs—</span>as these are.
But in Paris they went too far. Legs were a mere starter.
Whenever a person exhibits a moral impulse, you accuse
him of being a Puritan.”</p>

<p>“Exactly,” said McCall. “You don’t expect me to call
you a goddam prude in company. A person has to be
polite. Puritan is merely a euphuism.”</p>

<p>They argued genially for a while and then appealed to
Dr. Levin.</p>

<p>“As usual, you are both <span class="lock">wrong—</span>and both right,” said
Levin, lighting a cigarette. “McCall is a poet and a symbolist.
In what to you, Hamilton, would be a shocking
disregard of the morals, and to me a mere display of the
umbilical region, becomes in McCall’s mind a symbol of
freedom, of art, of life. But we’ve sat here almost an hour
and it’s time to be moving.”</p>

<p>At the Moulin Rouge, dimly lighted, with soft lights and
women’s gowns and jewels glowing subduedly, McCall
passed into a sentimental mood.</p>

<p>“Want to hear a little poem I wrote? Wrote it to the
sweetest little girl in the world, wrote it on the back of an
old envelope one day in the hospital.”</p>

<p>McCall was having difficulty with his “l’s.” A woman
with seductive arms and eyes leaned over to him from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
next table and smiled, while her escort was fumbling in his
pockets for some change.</p>

<p>“She’s the sweetest little girl in the world and I’ll never
see her <span class="lock">again—</span>never.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter? A lover’s quarrel?” asked Levin.</p>

<p>“No.” Morosely.</p>

<p>“Where’d you meet her?” asked Hamilton. “That’s a
new one on me. Paris?”</p>

<p>McCall nodded. He sipped a highball, ran his fingers
through his hair and began in a low, vibrant voice, his
handsome boyish face flushed.</p>

<p>McCall’s voice stopped. His long, slender fingers went
forward across the table and he sat staring down in front
of him. A waiter who had been standing near-by in respectful
silence, coughed. The lady at the next table, looking
haughtily ahead, swept by with her escort.</p>

<p>“It’s very pretty,” said Hamilton after a moment.</p>

<p>“Yes, I like it,” added Levin. Then with apparent irrelevance,
“I suppose you know that Miss Meadows is here,
in New York.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span></p>

<p>Hamilton betrayed his eagerness in a look.</p>

<p>“No, where is she?”</p>

<p>McCall was still staring at the table.</p>

<p>“She’s staying with a party of Red Cross nurses. Her
parents met her in New York, but went back alone. Of
course you’ll call on her. I know she’d be glad to see you.”</p>

<p>They walked out of the room together, McCall between
them, still absorbed in thought. His mood changed, however,
at Reisenweber’s. Opposite them sat a fat man in
full-dress, with a chorus girl upon each knee.</p>

<p>He was frankly hugging them and they were as frankly
pulling greenbacks out of his pockets and tucking them into
their stockings, conveniently rolled.</p>

<p>“Here’s civilization in America at its highest,” said Levin
cynically. “The fat man is a manufacturer who has been
yelling against the Bolsheviki for destroying the home. He’s
a bitter opponent of free love.”</p>

<p>McCall laughed.</p>

<p>“Well, why shouldn’t he be opposed to free love? He
has to pay for it, doesn’t he? He looks like a picture by
<span class="lock">Hogarth—</span>a picture in the Rake’s Progress. Only Death
ought to be lurking somewhere about.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he is,” said Levin, “although you can’t see him.
Life doesn’t reveal its spectres until the right moment. But
we’re all too introspective. A cabaret is frankly a place for
enjoyment. We ought to dance.”</p>

<p>“I’d rather just look on,” said Hamilton.</p>

<p>“And I’m going to dance,” said McCall. “Watch me!”</p>

<p>He lurched unsteadily past the fat man and his odalisques
to a table where two dazzling <span class="lock">blondes—</span>a peroxide and a
<span class="lock">henna—</span>sat waiting. The next minute he was fox-trotting
with the peroxide blonde. The fat man and the two girls
rose and went laughing and swaying out of the door. Another
officer sat down with the henna blonde. A couple
walked by, the woman’s black eyes beckoning to Hamilton,
while her escort was looking the other way. The waiter
yawned. Hamilton looked at his watch.</p>

<p>“Wow, it’s after three! We’ll have to catch the four<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
o’clock to make reveille and then we won’t get any sleep.”</p>

<p>“Do you still have to stand reveille?” asked Levin.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ve got a couple of shavetails who take turns at
standing it with the <span class="lock">company—</span>and for all I know they may
leave it to the top-sergeant. But our major’s a little fussy.
Doesn’t know the war’s over, and he might kick.”</p>

<p>“Well, you get McCall, and in the meantime I’ll order a
round of coffees. That’ll keep you awake until reveille, and
then you can sleep.”</p>

<p>Hamilton found McCall making arrangements with the
lady in henna, the other officer and the peroxide blonde to
visit a little apartment uptown, but dragged him away.
McCall refused to drink his coffee, but finally consented to
leave and walked out between them to the taxi.</p>

<p>They drove to the Pennsylvania station and Levin saw
them to the gates leading to their track.</p>

<p>“Let’s see, what was that address?” asked Hamilton.</p>

<p>“Miss Meadows? Here it is. Better write it down. Got
a pencil? All right. Well, so long. Look me up again.
Come to see me when you’re in Chicago. Good-night,
McCall.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XV"><abbr title="Fifteen">XV</abbr></h2>
</div>

<p>Hamilton was lying leisurely on his bed, smoking a
cigarette and reading a letter from Margaret, when McCall
burst into the room.</p>

<p>“Got my order! Got my order!” he shouted, waving a
slip of paper. “Hooray! Kaloo! Kalay! Come on,
Hamilton, help me pack.”</p>

<p>“Gee, great stuff!” said Hamilton, jumping up. “When
did it come?”</p>

<p>“Just now! Hooray! I haven’t packed a thing. I’m
going to take my physical exam at eleven and catch the
noon train, if I can. It’s half-past nine now.”</p>

<p>“Have you signed your statement that you’re free from
indebtedness?”</p>

<p>“Almost forgot. But I can do it and make the train,
anyway. Come on, old top, give me a lift!”</p>

<p>Together they hurried out of the room and down the row
of wooden barracks. McCall was talking excitedly.</p>

<p>“No more of these damned barracks, all looking alike,”
he said. “That’s the worst thing about the camp. Every
blamed building looks like every other building. If they’d
only make one a little longer than the other. Or even get
the lines crooked. Or paint ’em.”</p>

<p>In McCall’s room they found two privates folding an
iron cot.</p>

<p>“That’s right, boys. Get all this junk out and sweep the
floor when you get through. Here’s a couple of uniforms
I won’t need any more. Want ’em? Fine! And here’s a
pair of putts. I’ll see you in the office again before I go.”</p>

<p>The soldiers saluted with a relaxed stiffness and broad
grins on their faces, turned on their heels and walked out.</p>

<p>“Why did you want to give away your uniforms and
putts?” asked Hamilton. “You can use ’em for riding or
camping, you know.”</p>

<p>“Riding or camping? Here, hand me those shaving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
things off that shelf. When do you think I’ll have a chance
to go riding? If they ever send me on an assignment
where I’ll need <span class="lock">putts—</span>such as covering another <span class="lock">war—</span>I’ll
buy a pair. But, of course, there won’t be any more wars.
Let’s see, where’ll I put my socks?”</p>

<p>Hamilton was removing articles from a wooden shelf
that extended over the foot of the <span class="lock">bed—</span>a few photographs,
books, stationery, brush, comb, a soap box, a tobacco pouch,
a shoe brush and some face towels. As he picked up one of
the volumes, a snapshot, which had been kept between the
leaves, fluttered down upon the floor and Hamilton stooped
to recover it. It was Dorothy Meadows, standing at the
entrance to the hospital in <span class="lock">Paris—</span>Dorothy in her nurse’s
cloak and bonnet, smiling at him. McCall looked up from
his packing.</p>

<p>“<em>What</em> is that?” he asked. “Oh, one of my snapshots.”</p>

<p>“Where’d you get this?” asked Hamilton, his face red
from bending.</p>

<p>“In Paris. Took it with her camera. You know she’s
been an angel of mercy to us, Hamilton.”</p>

<p>Hamilton’s mind went back to the New York cabaret,
where McCall had sat reciting poetry with shining eyes,
and an emotion strangely like that of jealousy seized him.
He thought of their walk in Luxembourg gardens. Of
course it could not be jealousy. Still the feeling persisted
and he hardly heard what McCall was saying. If he had
not been in love with Margaret, this feeling would be understandable.
As it was, it was fantastic. Perhaps McCall
had not written the poem to Dorothy.</p>

<p>“Got to get transportation,” said McCall, standing up,
after the last strap had been tightened and the last lock
turned. “I’ll call up the supply department. Come on!”</p>

<p>They rushed out to the Y. M. C. A., where the nearest
telephone was, and McCall disappeared into the booth. He
reappeared a few minutes later.</p>

<p>“Sending for it right away. Let’s go back.”</p>

<p>A few minutes later a truck appeared and McCall’s locker
trunks and bedding roll were being loaded into it. It seemed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
very strange. For almost two years they had been together.
In the same company at Plattsburg, where they
had gotten their commissions together; in the same company
at Camp Eustis, where they had drilled rookies; in
the same company in France, until casualties had placed
each in charge of his own company. They had received
their promotions to first lieutenancies and to captaincies on
the same day. They had studied together and fought together.
Side by side they had stood in muddy trenches.
They had tasted the same dangers and hardships, the same
hopes and anxieties, the same enthusiasms and pleasures.
Now they were to be separated.</p>

<p>McCall was going back to Chicago. In a few days Hamilton
was going back to <span class="lock">Corinth—</span>and then what would become
of their friendship? Parting would sever something
from Hamilton’s life. Yes, life was that, a meeting and a
parting. One made friends, built up a community of interests,
and then the friend moved away or died or grew up
into a different being. The next time they met, Hamilton
might be engrossed in something <span class="lock">else—</span>possibly the details
of the Hamilton enterprises and, as conceivably, McCall
would be engrossed in his work.</p>

<p>Hamilton had met old schoolmates like <span class="lock">that—</span>boys with
whom he played football at prep school, boys with whom he
had gone on larks, even members of the same club at Harvard.
For a few minutes they were always glad to see each
other. They recalled old memories. They asked about old
friends, almost forgotten, whom neither had seen again.
Then they suddenly discovered that they were both bored.
Each had his own interests, had become a strange being.
It was difficult to pick up old friendships where one had
left off.</p>

<p>McCall was chattering on happily:</p>

<p>“There’s a hundred things to do to get away from camp.
Coming down with me to the Q. M.’s? I’ll tell you; you be
in your room and as soon as I get through I’ll drop in
again.”</p>

<p>McCall was swinging rapidly down the road, stopping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
now and then to shake hands with friends, or to shout
“good-bye” excitedly across the road. Hamilton returned
to his room. Everything was in order, in case his discharge
should come. He could pack within fifteen minutes.
He idly went over some reports, ran a brush over his
shoes and puttees, and lay down again on his bed. He loosened
his coat, took out his letter from Margaret and reread
it. Margaret was to sing before the Daughters of the Confederacy
and had just been appointed on a committee to
welcome the returning soldiers.</p>

<p>Hamilton was dozing away comfortably when McCall
burst into the door, a suitcase in either hand.</p>

<p>“Well, so long, Hamilton, I’m going.”</p>

<p>“Just a minute, I’ll go down with you.” Hamilton
sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>“Only ten minutes left. All right, your coat’s all right.”</p>

<p>Hamilton took one of the suitcases and together they
rushed out of the barracks. They hailed a Q. M. truck,
loaded the suitcases onto it, and crowded into the seat next
to the driver. At the station stood little knots of soldiers
and officers waiting for the train. There was much laughing
and talking, buying of newspapers and candy bars at
the counters, and a crush at the ticket and baggage offices.</p>

<p>The train was here. Every one made a rush for the door.
Last farewells were said, last addresses exchanged. McCall
was waving his arms and shaking hands with everyone.
There was no time for even a last word. Hamilton wished
to say <span class="lock">something—</span>something about their friendship, something
about the saving of his life in France. But it was
too late. McCall was being pushed forward to the train.
He found a seat next to the window, opened it and shouted:
“So long!” The next minute the train started, the cheering
and laughing mingled with the noise of the locomotive
gaining momentum, the waving arms and grinning faces
receded in the distance.</p>

<p>Hamilton wondered when he would go home, looked
around and walked back to his barrack alone.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">


<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XVI"><abbr title="Sixteen">XVI</abbr></h2>
</div>

<p>Hamilton’s discharge came late the next day and he decided
to leave the following morning. He made the rounds
of his most intimate friends, wrote a few letters and retired
early. He would reach New York by noon, spend the day
there, so as to avoid traveling by day as much as possible,
and leave at six o’clock for Washington. He would have
time to visit the office of the Hamilton Company, see
Levin and perhaps even call up Dorothy.</p>

<p>Hamilton left earlier than he had expected and reached
New York at eleven o’clock. The city was still in gala mood.
There was a committee of women to meet the soldiers with
coffee and doughnuts. Hamilton had breakfasted well in
camp and expected to eat luncheon shortly, but out of consideration
for the plump blonde chairwoman, he managed
to gulp down the doughnut and coffee and thank her profusely.
A slender, dark girl, evidently Jewish, gave him a
package of cigarettes. Hamilton noticed that most of the
soldiers, although they had been stuffing on peanut candy
and chocolate bars all the way from camp, also took their
doughnuts and coffee dutifully.</p>

<p>The streets were still decorated with flags, bunting and
signs welcoming the returning soldiers. The many uniforms
on the streets, while not enjoying the popularity of a month
ago, had not yet become objects of odium. Women, and a
few men, still looked with sympathy at soldiers who limped
about on crutches or walked about minus an arm.</p>

<p>Hamilton walked leisurely up Broadway, his chest high
and his shoulders still squared by custom. The civilians,
dodging about, looked pale, round-shouldered and nervous.
He peered upward at the tall buildings and felt a glow of
pride. He stopped at a cigar store to light a cigarette,
watched the men throwing dice, and envied their freedom.
It must be splendid not to have to stand reveille, not to have
to stand retreat, not to have to eat at a certain hour, not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
to have to stand or do anything unless one wished to. How
happy they must be. Then he suddenly realized that he was
one of them, and that though still in uniform he was just
as free. He stuck a hand in his pocket in defiance of old
military etiquette and in a burst of new-found freedom,
thought better of it, withdrew it and walked on.</p>

<p>Hamilton wished he had waited for the noon train and
come down with some of the other officers of his regiment.
Wandering about New York alone was too big a task for
one man. There were so many thoughts he wished to express,
so many ideas to exchange. He wondered what McCall
would think about the men and women he passed on
the <span class="lock">streets—</span>the clerks, the girls with short skirts borrowed
from the French, the women who smiled because one was
in uniform, the business men who looked away for the
same reason, the messenger boys, whose admiration and
hero worship had outlived the armistice.</p>

<p>Why had he come alone at the last minute? He had
planned to come at <span class="lock">noon—</span>had practically slipped away from
camp. His mind reverted to Dorothy, although he had decided
not to see her. Dorothy would be surprised to see
him and probably chagrined that it was not McCall. Why
had not McCall told him anything about the poem or the
snapshot? Still, why should he?</p>

<p>Perhaps after all there was no more between them than
between himself and her. McCall was on his way back to
Chicago. Perhaps he had called on Dorothy while waiting
for his train. Had he come alone to New York in order to
be able to spend more time with Dorothy?</p>

<p>No, he would not see her. He would not see her. First,
because of the emotional character of their farewell in Paris.
In a sentimental vein he might again commit the same kind
of folly. She might misconstrue his avowal of friendship
for something deeper. Secondly, he would not see her because
McCall had written that poem to her. He was not
jealous. A ridiculous idea.</p>

<p>He reached the office building in which the Hamilton
Company was located and rode up in the elevator to his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
floor. He walked to the end of the corridor and was turning
the knob of the door when he noticed that the lettering was
changed. He stepped back, looked about in bewilderment
and finally entered. Yes, the office was differently arranged
and there was a strange stenographer at the information
desk. He had been here too often to mistake the number;
still, if they had moved, his father would undoubtedly have
told him something about it.</p>

<p>“Could you please tell me where the Hamilton Company
is located?” he asked.</p>

<p>The stenographer, fluffy brown-haired and brown-eyed,
looked up, smiled and showed a row of white teeth.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Been here only a month, but the elevator
man might know.”</p>

<p>She looked a moment at his uniform.</p>

<p>“You’re a corporal or something, aren’t you? I can tell
by the things on your sleeve. I’ve got a gentleman friend
who’s a corporal, too.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Hamilton, about to turn away, when a
stout gentleman came up behind the information desk.</p>

<p>“Did you inquire about the Hamilton Company, Captain?”
he asked. “We moved in after they left, on the
second of January.” The gentleman did not know where
the company had moved, but referred Hamilton to the office
of the building on the top floor.</p>

<p>On the top floor the secretary knew only that the office
had been vacated December thirty-first and that no New
York forwarding address had been left. All the mail, he
added, was being sent to some southern <span class="lock">address—</span>Virginia
or <span class="lock">Carolina—</span>no Corinth, Georgia, that was it.</p>

<p>Hamilton’s mind was in a whirl. Why had the New
York office been discontinued? Why had his father not
told him about it? He had received a letter from him
only a few days ago. The New York office had been opened
in 1915, when the rush of war orders had made it advisable
to go directly into exporting, instead of dealing through
brokers. It had not only saved the brokerage commission
(a comparatively small item), but, what was more important,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
had brought many new orders. Perhaps with the war
over, it was no longer needed.</p>

<p>It was nearly twelve now, and Hamilton decided to telephone
Levin and eat luncheon with him. He stepped into
a cigar store and called up his hotel. Levin had left fifteen
minutes before, with a suitcase. They hardly expected him
back before night. No, he had not left any instructions.
Hamilton hung up the receiver and wondered why he
had not thought to wire the night before. This reminded
him that he had not yet wired home and he left for the
nearest telegraph office where he sent off two <span class="lock">messages—</span>one
to his mother and one to Margaret. Then he set out
in search of a restaurant.</p>

<p>There was a cold look about the restaurants. They were
either too large and imposing or two white and busy. He
wondered whether he could find anything like the Black Cat
in New York. He wished that he had come with some one
else and visited several hotels in the hope of finding some
one he knew in the lobby.</p>

<p>He was on the point of telephoning a few of his New
York acquaintances when he recalled that they were all still
in the service. If this were only Paris, he thought. He
could sit down in any café and engage in conversation with
whomever he pleased, man or woman, without violating the
proprieties. It was about four months since he had eaten at
the Black Cat with Dorothy. Four whole months.</p>

<p>Why not have luncheon with her? They could recall their
experiences in Paris. They might spend the afternoon
together. Hamilton remembered the address. He had said
it over and over to himself at odd moments. It was only
a mile or so away. No, that would be a weakness on his
part. That would be an admission of something that he did
not wish to face even in his mind. He would simply write
her a note, saying that he had been in New York and had
not found time to call.</p>

<p>He walked to the curb and held up his hand to a taxi,
gave the driver a number and stepped in. He was still debating
whether he should call on Dorothy or not when the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
cab stopped, the driver opened the door and he found himself
actually standing outside her apartment. It would be
foolish to turn back now. Perhaps she had seen him through
the window.</p>

<p>He paid the chauffeur and climbed the stairs with throbbing
heart. It was an old <span class="lock">building—</span>one of a row of old
brownstone houses, which had long since been altered into
flats, family hotels and specialty shops. It had an air of
venerable, picturesque decay, an atmosphere of an older, less
feverish, more homogeneous New York. In the heavy oak
door, beneath a polished brass knocker, he found a button
and pressed it. Presently the door opened and a gray-haired
lady, with a piqued face and gold-rimmed spectacles, peered
guardedly through the opening and falteringly inquired his
business. He told her.</p>

<p>After a moment’s inspection, she let him enter and ushered
him into the front <span class="lock">room—</span>a high-ceilinged one, with a
bay window, a white-tiled mantel in one corner and a heavy
flowered carpet on the floor. Miss Meadows would be
back at one o’clock. It was almost that now and would he
sit down there and look at the papers until she came?</p>

<p>Hamilton contented himself with gazing about the room.
He walked over to the mantelpiece and idly inspected the
<span class="lock">ornaments—</span>a china clock, an old-fashioned Dresden doll,
and a vase containing fresh violets. He remembered that
he had neglected to bring Dorothy flowers.</p>

<p>He turned to face the window, across which a heavily upholstered
red plush settee extended. Through the lace curtain
the spring sunshine fell in a golden stream. The
sounds of passing persons and vehicles came to him from
the street. Suddenly in the sunlight he noticed an <span class="lock">envelope—</span>a
long official envelope. He felt of his pockets, which
were bristling with official orders, as he stooped to pick it
up. He had probably dropped it in removing his handkerchief.
Yes, it bore his name. He was straightening up,
when he heard footsteps on the stairs and a voice which he
recognized as Dorothy’s. He had time to place the letter
in his pocket when the door opened and Dorothy came in,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
her arms stretched out, a smile on her flushed face. Hamilton
noticed that little strands of hair were blowing loose.</p>

<p>“Captain Hamilton, how are you?” she crossed over to
him and gave him her hands. Hamilton’s heart beat wildly.</p>

<p>“This is such a surprise. Dr. Levin told me he had seen
you.”</p>

<p>Hamilton mumbled something and was conscious of being
very red.</p>

<p>“Yes. I’m going back to Corinth tonight and I thought
I should like to see you before I <span class="lock">leave—</span>renew our acquaintance.”</p>

<p>“That was splendid of you,” she said.</p>

<p>In a few words they told what had happened since their
last meeting and finally Hamilton suggested that they lunch
together.</p>

<p>“I don’t suppose we can find a Black Cat here, but perhaps
Claridge’s might do for a substitute,” he suggested.</p>

<p>She expressed her delight and excused herself to go into
the next room and change to more suitable attire. When she
reappeared she seemed more radiantly beautiful than ever.
She had slipped on a filmy dress of blue crêpe bordered
with silver.</p>

<p>“You look charming!” he said.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s the conventional thing to say,” she retorted.
“That’s what every one says.”</p>

<p>“No wonder every one says it!”</p>

<p>“And that’s conventional, too,” said Dorothy with an
arch frown. She was patting her hair into position and
taking one last look at herself in the mirror above the mantel.
“But today let’s not be conventional. You are going
to Corinth. I don’t know when we’ll meet again. So let’s
not spend our time in looking at each other through masks.”
They were walking down the stairs now. “No, don’t interrupt;
and you were going to say, ‘But I meant it.’ It’s like
a game. Your partner leads with this remark and you come
back with that. Ordinarily, I can tell exactly what a man is
going to reply to whatever I say.”</p>

<p>In the taxi, she resumed the thread of her thought.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span></p>

<p>“Why can’t men and women talk to each other just as
two men do?”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t they?”</p>

<p>“No, they simply bandy expressions back and forth like
a tennis ball. The man always flatters the woman. She
always deprecates his words, and he affirms them.”</p>

<p>She turned to him suddenly.</p>

<p>“What do you talk about when, say, you are with Captain
McCall?”</p>

<p>Hamilton smiled.</p>

<p>“Oh, the same things I talk to you about.”</p>

<p>“No you don’t. You don’t say he has a lovely uniform.
You discuss things.”</p>

<p>“Has McCall been here?”</p>

<p>“Why no. When will he be discharged?”</p>

<p>“He left the day before yesterday. I was almost certain
he’d visit you before leaving for Chicago. It’s queer.”</p>

<p>“Queer? Why should it be? He’s probably forgotten
all about me, or was in too much of a hurry to stop off
here.”</p>

<p>For some reason Hamilton felt immensely relieved. It
was as though a curtain had been lifted from before his
eyes. He had been mistaken in thinking that McCall had
referred to Dorothy at the café. The poem had not been
written to her. Hamilton’s mind ran back to the finding of
the snapshot. It, too, probably had no particular significance.
McCall had probably a hundred snapshots of Paris.
Hamilton talked on without being fully conscious of what
either he or Dorothy were saying. It was something about
men and women, and Hamilton reflected that any conversation
with women invariably resolved itself into the relations
of the two <span class="lock">sexes—</span>to love, to marriage, to standards of
morality.</p>

<p>“And that’s what I admire about Dr. Levin,” Dorothy
was saying. Hamilton did not remember what had led to
this remark.</p>

<p>“You admire—” he groped.</p>

<p>“Yes, I admire his sex unconsciousness,” she repeated.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
“He treats me, not exactly like a man, but like an intellectual
equal.”</p>

<p>The idea amused Hamilton.</p>

<p>“And what do you talk about?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, we discuss things. Just as two men would. Politics,
sociology, literature, art.”</p>

<p>Hamilton laughed.</p>

<p>“Just as two men. You mean just as two Dr. Levins.
When two men get together they <span class="lock">talk—</span>well, where I come
from, they’d probably talk about hunting, or the cotton crop,
or baseball or what would have happened if it hadn’t been
for the <span class="lock">war—</span>that is, the Civil War. I called Dr. Levin
when I came in, but they told me—”</p>

<p>“Yes, he’s gone for about two days to visit a sister. Oh,
yes, and we even discuss such things as intermarriage.”</p>

<p>“That’s a rather dangerous subject, isn’t it?” he asked.
His mind went back once more to McCall, who was a Catholic.
Still this, too, was probably only part of their intellectual
conversation. It was probably impersonal.</p>

<p>“Perhaps.” She changed the subject.</p>

<p>At Claridge’s they watched the people about them. They
recognized some of them as actors and actresses, one of
them, a Broadway star active in the formation of the new
Equity League. In one corner sat a distinguished looking
gentleman, with cruel blue eyes and dark hair and beard,
surrounded by a group of admirers.</p>

<p>“That’s General Rodzinoff,” said Hamilton, “the Czarist
commander whom we saw in Paris. New York is becoming
cosmopolitan.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I remember him. He’s probably arousing sympathy
for the old régime,” remarked Dorothy. “The town
is full of them. The emigrés are tired of Paris and are
coming to this country. It’s more fertile.”</p>

<p>For a time they studied their menus. The colored waiter
took their order obsequiously and hurried away.</p>

<p>“Don’t look now,” said Dorothy in a low voice, “but your
Russian friend seems to be flirting.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span></p>

<p>“Has he been practising his charms on you?” asked Hamilton.</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s glanced this way once or twice. But I don’t
take it seriously. He’s probably spoiled by too much adulation.”</p>

<p>“And I suppose he’ll finish by marrying some American
millionaire’s daughter. Why shouldn’t he? He’s a great
war hero.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know about that,” Dorothy’s eyes snapped, “but
I do know that he can drink like a good Russian officer.
In Paris he was always more or less intoxicated, and if I
don’t mistake the symptoms, he’s a little mellow now. That’s
one of his favorite pastimes. The others are women and
Jew baiting.”</p>

<p>“Jew baiting?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Dr. Levin has told me of some of his activities in
Russia. He’s a regular <i>pogromchik</i>. That means an instigator
of those horrible massacres in Russia. I’m surprised
they tolerate him. I understand that he is spreading his
propaganda in this country.”</p>

<p>“What propaganda? Against the Jews?”</p>

<p>“Yes. In Russia when anything went wrong, the ruling
class always blamed the Jew. He was the scapegoat. If
taxes were high or wages low, it was the Jew who was at
fault. Now if General Rodzinoff can spread anti-Semitism
in this country, he may succeed also in spreading the false
impression that the Jews are the cause of all the trouble in
Russia. He may make people forget the oppression of the
old Czarist régime against which the people rebelled and
from which they went to the other extreme.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no. The American people are too sensible for that.
He might get a few fanatics, perhaps. But—” Hamilton
shrugged his shoulders and smiled. “Nobody of any standing.”</p>

<p>“Well, has Howard Brooks any standing?”</p>

<p>“Brooks?” Hamilton, like nine hundred and ninety-nine
Americans out of a thousand, knew Brooks as the inventor
and exploiter to the tune of many millions of the most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
widely-used automobile tire in the <span class="lock">world—</span>a tire which had
revolutionized the automobile industry and made it possible
for the first time in history for the farmer and small salaried
city man to operate his own car. Because of the peculiar
hissing sound they made, the tires were called “babbling
brooks”—but they did the work and were cheap. Brooks
had mobilized thousands of workmen, by paying them a
bit more than the other manufacturers, and had then
housed them and cared for them with an exacting, paternalistic
benevolence. It was as though a super-efficiency man
and the Kaiser had decided to go into charity on a vast scale.
Wages were higher, hours were shorter, operations were
safer than anywhere else; but while the men did work, they
worked like machines. Their production was astounding.
The lost moments in which workmen wipe their brows, blow
their noses or simply rest between processes had been reduced
so effectively that whereas seventeen per cent had
been the smallest lost time ever achieved in any factory,
Brooks had cut the percentage down to <span class="lock">six—</span>the minimum
of safety, efficiency engineers agreed. How long a man
could work at a six per cent <span class="lock">rate—</span>or rather a ninety-four
per cent rate, of course had never been determined, as the
system had been in operation only a few years and the labor
turnover was rather large.</p>

<p>Not only were the wages of Brooks’ employees higher
than the prevailing standard, but they were required to place
a certain percentage of it in the bank each week. There
were also numberless rules about conduct, about furnishing
the home, about physical care. No Brooks employee was
allowed to drink or smoke. Company investigators visited
the homes to see if the food was cooked scientifically and if
the baby was being fed the proper formula of prepared milk,
and, so it was whispered, to smell breaths.</p>

<p>When the European war began Brooks had engaged the
best aeronautic engineers to construct an enormous dirigible
balloon. The idea was to fly over the Atlantic with it and
then over the western front. Brooks and his assistants, selected
from representative clubs and associations, would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
drop tons of peace tracts upon the combating armies. Upon
reading these, the armies would cease fighting. “Out of the
trenches by apple blossom time,” was his motto. Incidentally
the balloon would have a powerful advertising value, as
the dirigible was to be known as the Brooks Peace Ship.
It wouldn’t hurt to get the good-will of foreign motor users
for after-the-war trade.</p>

<p>When a Chicago newspaper had poked fun at the plan
and Brooks had sued the paper for libel, Brooks had been
placed on the witness stand and exhibited a shocking ignorance
of the most elementary facts of American history.
When asked who Benjamin Franklin was, for instance, he
had replied that he was the inventor of an air-cooled automobile
motor and Benedict Arnold, an English author.</p>

<p>At the last minute the committee in charge of the airship
had fallen out as to where they should fly first, over the
French or over the Germans, without offending either of the
belligerents. It ended in a tremendous row, with every one
calling every one else a pro-German or a pro-Frenchman
and going home.</p>

<p>At the vaudeville shows, in the smokers of trains, in the
joke columns Brooks’ name appeared frequently. It was a
by-word and a signal for laughter. For one person to say
to another:</p>

<p>“Say, I see you’ve got a new set of rubber doughnuts
on your car,” was a cue for uproarious <span class="lock">laughter—</span>rubber
doughnuts of course meaning “babbling brooks.”</p>

<p>For all these reasons the mention of Brooks’ name caused
Hamilton to smile involuntarily. He waved his hand in a
deprecating gesture.</p>

<p>“Of course that strikes you as funny,” said Dorothy,
“but Brooks <em>has</em> <span class="lock">standing—</span>any man with so much money
has. Of course he has no culture, in fact is an ignoramus,
but he has money and can hire brains. Men will do anything
for money.”</p>

<p>Hamilton laughed.</p>

<p>“Hope I’ve heard my last Brooks joke,” he said. “But
where did you get all this information?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span></p>

<p>“Some of it from Dr. Levin. Some of it—”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see,” he interrupted. “Dr. Levin. Probably a little
sensitive. I’ve noticed most Jews are. Even in my company.
You say something about English or Irish or Italian
and nobody minds. You even say ‘wop’ and an Italian
grins good naturedly. But the minute you say something,
anything, good or bad, about the Jew, they’re all ears and
<span class="lock">eyes—</span>all on edge. I think Dr. Levin’s probably supersensitive.”</p>

<p>Hamilton refused to take the matter seriously. At the
same time he wondered why she brought Dr. Levin’s name
so often into the conversation. She had learned this from
Dr. Levin, and that. She quoted him and sometimes even
held him up as an example.</p>

<p>They finished their meal and left the Claridge, the Russian
general still charming his circle of admirers with his
conversation, his cruel blue eyes still circling the room for
fresh objects of feminine beauty.</p>

</div>

<p>“Now for another Luxembourg Garden,” said Hamilton
as they left the Claridge.</p>

<p>“It’s not exactly the same thing, but perhaps Central Park
might do,” suggested Dorothy. “I go there once in a while,
when I wish to escape <span class="lock">from—</span>from myself. We might go
there for a while. As long as you get me back by five.”</p>

<p>They boarded a Fifth Avenue bus and dismounted at
Fifty-ninth Street. Spring had scarce come and only the
first buds and the boldest blades of grass appeared, but it
was warm in the sunshine. Overhead innumerable birds proclaimed
their faith in the coming of another summer. And
the women on horseback along the bridle-paths or afoot
wore bright, spring clothes. Hamilton’s thoughts flew back
to Georgia. There the trees must be thick with foliage,
green leaves and sweet-scented magnolia blossoms, and roses
must be in bloom.</p>

<p>How long they walked together Hamilton did not know.
Nor did he know of what they spoke. In fact he said little,
leaving the burden of their conversation to Dorothy. His
mind was flying back and forth between the present and
the future. He was sensing the passing moments, perhaps
his last with the woman who walked at his side, with
such eagerness that he somehow missed their details. It
was as though he were saying: “This moment, this position
of her head, this touch of the sunlight upon her face,
all these are precious and will not return.” And in the
meantime the moment had melted into another and he had
lost the thread of their common talk.</p>

<p>Dorothy’s mind was <span class="lock">everywhere—</span>the war, its effect on
art, on literature, on morals, on conceptions of democracy.
The thread of their conversation was being broken and
picked up.</p>

<p>They had seated themselves on a bench when Hamilton<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
suddenly became aware of the lateness of the hour. In a
few minutes they would be riding home and there were so
many things to tell her. It seemed to him that she, too, was
waiting for something, something that had sprung up between
them and to which he must give voice.</p>

<p>“You know,” he said at length, “I’m engaged.”</p>

<p>It was not what he had wished to say, and the knowledge
that he had said it for a single moment appalled him.
He was glad in a way and proud that he had told her. In
another way he feared that he had been presumptuous. Was
that a tremor of her lip, or simply the play of light and
shadow? Or was it his imagination? No, her eyes were
still sparkling, happy. He was right. They were only
friends. They could be nothing else. And, though their
friendship was fated for nothing deeper; still it was right
that he had told her. He had done the right thing. It was
not a conflicting love, but the faint possibility of disloyalty
even in thought to the woman whom he had already chosen,
that he had shut out.</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t know, exactly,” she smiled. “For a time I
<span class="lock">thought—</span>I suppose it is the faithful little Southern girl
you left behind you, the one whose letters I used to bring
you.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, once when you were delirious you even paid
me the compliment of saying that I looked like her.”</p>

<p>For a fleeting instant Hamilton had an impression that
Dorothy was laughing at <span class="lock">him—</span>trying to laugh or trying
not to laugh, he could not tell which.</p>

<p>“I did say <span class="lock">that—</span>and I do. It was not delirium.”</p>

<p>She rose and Hamilton knew that his afternoon had come
to an end.</p>

<p>“No, don’t take me home. Just see me to the bus line. I’d
rather leave you that way,” she was smiling.</p>

<p>“This afternoon,” he said, “I shall always remember. It’s
been—” from somewhere a phrase popped into his head—“‘a
sheaf of golden moments.’”</p>

<p>Dorothy darted a quick look of surprise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span></p>

<p>“‘With here and there,’” she continued, “‘a scarlet memory.’”</p>

<p>Hamilton suddenly remembered where he had heard that
phrase. The memory gave him a queer shock. It seemed
as though he had suddenly intruded upon something. And
yet, she had said that McCall had not called on her before
returning home.</p>

<p>“Where did you hear that?” she asked. “I picked it up
somewhere in Paris, in the hospital.”</p>

<p>“I don’t remember,” he replied.</p>

<p>They had reached the street and a bus was approaching.
Dorothy held out her hand.</p>

<p>“We shall always be friends, I hope.” Were her eyes a
bit wistful?</p>

<p>“Yes, friends.”</p>

<p>She was climbing into the bus, her face flushed, little ends
of brown hair blowing free from under her turban. Hamilton
remembered their last leave-taking in the Luxembourg
gardens. Through the window he caught a glimpse
of her walking forward to a seat, smiling as he had seen
her smiling in the hospital, when caring for the wounded.</p>

<p>He wondered if there were tears on her lashes.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XVIII"><abbr title="Eighteen">XVIII</abbr></h2>
</div>

<p>When Hamilton looked out of the window of his Pullman
the next morning he noticed that the earth was red.
He had left the land of dark earth, the cities of gray streets
and walks. He had left the cold North and was back
home in the South. The hills, rolling in every direction to
the slowly rotating horizon, were covered with greenery, and
a warmer, more golden sunshine brightened it. It seemed,
too, that the sky was bluer. And, peeping out from between
the trees and shrubs and running along the roads and <span class="lock">ditches—</span>red
earth.</p>

<p>At noon he saw for the first time in two years a little
patch covered with scrubby green plants, just bursting into
fluffy white blossoms. In one corner of the field a shack,
weather-beaten, gray, unpainted, with a sagging door and
broken windows. A Negro mammy in the doorway, a half-dozen
pickaninnies playing at her feet, all in rags. Out in
the field a white-haired Negro, bent under the load of a
crate piled high with cotton, tottering toward the shack.
The heads and backs of other Negroes bending over their
cotton.</p>

<p>It was only a patch. It was too far north for the heavier
yields of cotton. Yet, it was cotton!</p>

<p>It kept growing warmer. Hamilton’s coat became too
heavy. He wished that he had taken his cotton uniform
with him. He noticed how the vegetation kept growing
thicker as they proceeded southward. Now the forests
through which they passed were so thick that one could not
see into them. Vines and creepers, heavy moss, thick
shrubs, high grass, all knit the forest into a single being.
The grass grew up to the tracks and even between them.</p>

<p>The towns too were <span class="lock">different—</span>smaller, slower, dingier.
It was a different world, a more picturesque world, and a
more primitive one. He noticed, with a new insight into
such things, how much of the towns was <span class="lock">wooden—</span>stores,
factories, public buildings, and, of course, homes. Even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
the sidewalks. Also there were more wagons drawn by
horse or mule. The streets looked crooked and unpaved.
The structures unpainted. Men stood around or moved
<span class="lock">slowly—</span>at the stations, on the streets. And everywhere
there were Negroes. Negroes moving trucks at the depots.
Negroes lazily driving their teams along the roads. Negroes
on the streets. Negroes on the farms and plantations. Negroes
even behind the counters of stores. He had never
before realized how black the South was, how many less
white men than in the North. Previously most of his life
away from home had been spent at school, a world where
black men seldom intruded. But now they seemed like a
tide of color, like a forest pressing down upon the little
towns and villages, slowly choking them with their prolific
vegetation.</p>

<p>He thought of Williams and of the Paris salons that had
been thrown open to him and to other colored soldiers who
had fought under the same flag as the white men. He
watched the ragged black patiently toiling under the Southern
sun. He wondered whether they would be content to
remain thus. An idea struck him. He examined the individual
figures more closely. Yes! He had noticed something
familiar about the shirts that some of the laborers
wore. They were the olive drab of the army. And there
was a husky in olive drab breeches and army shoes.</p>

<p>It was five o’clock. Hamilton looked through his time
table again. He had wired his father to meet him at a
suburb one station north of Corinth. It was about the same
distance from home as the main station, but he wished to
avoid anything approaching a public reception. He had
entered the service as a student officer. He was coming
back a captain. Some of the home guards might not understand
how automatic promotion was. They might greet
him with a band or something equally nonsensical. He
wished to come home quietly. He wished to rest. He
<span class="lock">wished—</span>he did not <span class="lock">know—</span>yes, Margaret. He wished to
see her again. He wished to have the wedding as soon as
possible and settle down to his new life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span></p>

<p>The train was screeching to a halt and through the window
he saw them waiting for <span class="lock">him—</span>his father, a little paler
than when he had seen him in New York, it seemed; his
mother, clutching his arm, and trying not to <span class="lock">cry—</span>it was
the same way she looked when she had bade him good-bye,
only she, too, seemed a little older, and then Margaret,
flushed and radiant, in a bright yellow silk sweater.</p>

<p>The next minute he was down the steps and into his
mother’s arms. Yes, she was older, but not very much, and
still <span class="lock">beautiful—</span>with her white hair and girlish complexion,
her gentle blue eyes, her refined features. Hamilton remembered
the time that a schoolmate had mistaken his
mother and his only sister, Virginia Ruth, for sisters. Virginia
Ruth was married to a New Orleans banker and had
children of her own now. But no one would any longer
mistake the two for sisters. One cheated time for a while,
for a few years; but, in the end, time won.</p>

<p>Hamilton could think of nothing to say, but “Mother, how
are you?”</p>

<p>Of the hundred questions that crowded in her brain, all
that she could ask was: “Robert, isn’t your uniform too
warm?” The gulf between them was suddenly bridged and
they laughed.</p>

<p>Superintended by Mr. Hamilton, George, the middle-aged
Negro chauffeur, was proudly piling the suitcases into the
family automobile. He was grinning from ear to ear and
remarked repeatedly that “the gen’ral sure do look well”
and something about “bein’ mighty scrumptious.” Father
and son shook hands briefly, but Margaret held out her arms
and drew down Hamilton’s head. It was the first time that
he had kissed her in the presence of anybody else, the
first time he had kissed any one, outside the family, before
his mother and he felt awkward and self-conscious. As
he bent down, he noticed the sparkle of emeralds and diamonds
in her engagement ring and felt ashamed that he had
eyes for anything but Margaret herself. He noted how
calmly she could kiss <span class="lock">him—</span>not exactly calmly, but self-possessedly
and without embarrassment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span></p>

<p>With his first glance, too, he saw how beautiful she really
was and how strikingly similar her beauty was, in a way, to
that of Dorothy. Only it had a quality of naiveté. She
looked, if not actually younger in years, younger in spirit.
Hers was the naive sophistication of the rising <span class="lock">generation—</span>a
generation wise in its own conventionalities, the conventionalities
of breaking older conventionalities.</p>

<p>It was surprising how her set, among the sons and daughters
of the best families in Georgia, could assimilate so readily
the spirit of the new freedom, without, at the same time,
absorbing its intellectual aspects. Margaret, for instance,
knew nothing about political or economic movements save
as they came filtered to her through the mind of her parents.
The freedom, therefore, was exhibited mainly in the
social <span class="lock">sphere—</span>in attending dances and parties unchaperoned,
in driving her own motor car, in discussing love and
sex <span class="lock">theories—</span>generally gleaned from motion pictures or
printed <span class="lock">stories—</span>in dressing more freely than her mother
had done, in staying away with increasing frequency from
church, in smoking cigarettes surreptitiously and even in
drinking away from <span class="lock">home—</span>a little.</p>

<p>She had no real discrimination in her choice of either
art, literature or cigarettes. She had no favorite schools or
intellectual movements. And no theories. She simply liked
a picture or a book, or didn’t like <span class="lock">it—</span>her emancipation from
the old conventionalities expressing itself simply in a frankness
in expressing her opinion. Whereas her mother would
have admired a painting because she thought that was the
thing to do, with Margaret the thing to do was to say you
didn’t like it if you didn’t. But her taste for <span class="lock">fiction—</span>the
only kind of literature she <span class="lock">read—</span>was omnivorous. In music,
too, her tastes were of contradictory breadth, preferring
Beethoven one night and jazz the next. She played
the piano. Classical music when there were older visitors,
old ballads when alone with her mother, jazz music when
in her own set. When there was no one else with her she
played the three categories in the order of jazz first, then
ballads, and lastly classical music.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span></p>

<p>Margaret was a joy on a horse and a mermaid in the
water and altogether a creditable product of the finishing
school which her mother had selected for her. The best
testimony to this being the fact that she could have married
a half dozen of the most eligible young Corinthians, since
her graduation, two years ago in June.</p>

<p>The Hamiltons climbed into the touring car, the returned
hero seating himself between his mother and his fiancée,
while the father took one of the collapsible seats. The
home-coming had not been unseen by a crowd of tatterdemalion
colored children, who viewed Captain Hamilton
with awe until he disappeared down the street.</p>

<p>Hamilton was conscious of many things and of many
emotions: warm sunshine bathing the town and fragrant
blooming magnolia trees overarching the road; glimpses of
familiar houses; the street down which he had attempted
to elope with Margaret; the public school-house where he
had been set upon and in which he had triumphed in his last
fight of childhood; a magnificent old church which he used
to admire profoundly as a boy; homes of old friends. He
was conscious of the love and pride of the three with whom
he rode and the feeling of possession of Margaret, whose
eyes were on him, as much as his mother’s.</p>

<p>“Your wound is quite all right?” asked Mr. Hamilton sitting
sidewise in his seat.</p>

<p>“It’s fine,” Hamilton assured him. “Couldn’t be better.
I think I could even take the sorrel over the fence.”</p>

<p>“Robert, you wouldn’t do that?” said his mother reprovingly,
while his father and Margaret laughed. “Taking the
sorrel over the fence” had become a family joke, an expression
for extreme recklessness, because shortly before
leaving for New York, Robert, on a dare, had actually
jumped the stone fence on the sorrel, Annabell Lee. As his
father had said at the time, Robert had risked the knees of
a very valuable horse and the neck of a very heedless rider.</p>

<p>“No, there’s not much chance after the bawling out I
got last time.” Mr. Hamilton smiled.</p>

<p>“But Annabell is waiting for you,” he said, “all groomed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
up sleek and shiny by George himself, here.”</p>

<p>The chauffeur’s white-teethed grin was reflected in the
windshield as he nodded his head. “Tha’s right, sir, that’s
right. Annabell Lee, there ain’t no horses slicker than her.
She like mahogany.”</p>

<p>“Well, I won’t take any fences. But how are you,
mother? It’s wonderful to be back.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll take you out riding,” suggested Margaret eagerly.
“I know just a ripping place to go, and I’ll race you.”</p>

<p>“Not for a while, Margaret, I’m too lazy for much of anything
right now. If I go I’ll take old Major. How is
Major?”</p>

<p>“He’s not with us any more, Robert.”</p>

<p>“Did he die?”</p>

<p>Robert looked from his father to his mother. Her eyes
faltered.</p>

<p>“No, we sold him,” said Mr. Hamilton.</p>

<p>“Getting old, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“Oh, have I told you? We’ve got another captain in our
set,” asked Margaret suddenly. “Who do you think?
Howard Pinkney. He got his commission just about the
time I got that awful letter telling me you were wounded.
I’ll never forget how I felt.”</p>

<p>“Pinkney?”</p>

<p>“Oh, this town is full of ’em,” the elder Hamilton
laughed, with the faintest suggestion of irony in his voice.
“Captains and majors.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, he’s a real captain. He showed me his commission.
He’s captain of our home guards, and he says it’s the
same rank as captain in the infantry or artillery. Is it?”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s a rather embarrassing question. But perhaps
we could say that it’s not <em>exactly</em> the same thing, although
it is very nearly.”</p>

<p>“Oh, of course, you did the <em>real</em> fighting. It was wonderful
how you risked your life and I’m proud of you, oh,
ever so proud. I’ve had a service flag in the window ever
since you left, with only one <span class="lock">star—</span>for you. Howard
wanted me to have two stars, but, of course, he stayed at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
home. He’s one of the organizers now of the Trick Track
Tribe. Or is that a secret, Mr. Hamilton? He’ll be asking
Robert to join anyway.”</p>

<p>“It’s probably a pretty open secret.”</p>

<p>“Trick Track Tribe? What an odd name. Trick Track.
It sounds like the cocking of an old-fashioned musket.
Trick Track.”</p>

<p>“That’s just what it’s supposed to be. It’s a wonderful
thing. It’s to revive the old Southern chivalry and maintain
the superiority of the white race and promote Americanism.”</p>

<p>“That sounds pretty ambitious,” laughed Robert. “I
really didn’t know the white race was in danger. But if the
Trick Tracks can do all that, I’m for them.”</p>

<p>Now the car was rounding a corner and the next minute
the Hamilton residence appeared at the end of a row of tall
trees. There were the familiar pillars, rising from the floor
of the porch to the cornice; the little grilled window just
over the door, looking out from the landing on the stairs
and through which Hamilton had often peered as a boy;
the porch swing; the green shutters, breaking up the mass
of white; the lattice under the porch, behind which Hamilton
had often prowled, playing it was a bandit’s cave. The
grass was as green and the vines clambered as thickly about
the sides of the home as his memory had pictured.</p>

<p>“Your room, dear, is just the way you left it,” remarked
Mrs. Hamilton as the car drove up the path with a scream
of the siren.</p>

<p>They dismounted, George springing down in time to open
the door and then bringing up the rear with the suitcases.
Robert had expected to see the colored servants at the <span class="lock">door—</span>Mammy
Chloe, who baked memorial corn fritters and
candied yams, and her two daughters, Clorabelle and Susy
May (sometimes facetiously called Chlorine by Robert),
the housemaids, and Sam, a white-haired black of uncertain
age who looked after the horses, trimmed the grass and
otherwise assisted George. But only Mammy Chloe appeared,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
in her best apron, a clean, white kerchief around
her head, rocking her fat sides in happiness.</p>

<p>“Lor’ bless us if it ain’t Genril Robert hisself.”</p>

<p>“Only captain so far, Mammy Chloe,” Robert corrected
her, as he took her hands in his and looked down at her.
“Have you got any of those corn fritters ready for me?
I’m sure hungry.” This tribute to her culinary skill pleased
her prodigiously.</p>

<p>“Corn fritters ain’t nothing to what I done fix for you
all. An’ I won’t tell you what they is. You jes’ wait till
come dinner. My lan’ sakes, what all them Huns do to
you? You wait! You old Mammy Chloe get you fat again,
so Miss Margaret won’t know you.”</p>

<p>After George had deposited the suitcases in his room and
Mrs. Hamilton had kissed Robert and closed the door
gently behind her, Robert sank down in his chair. He was
tired and warm. He had almost forgotten about his wound,
yet the simple matter of traveling for thirty-six hours was
telling on him. He slowly unbuttoned his coat, unfastened
his puttees and unlaced his shoes. It would be a good half-hour
before dinner.</p>

<p>He removed a cigarette from his pocket, lit it and began
looking about the room. It was exactly as he had left it.
The same high-ceilinged room, with its friendly ivory woodwork;
the same inviting bay windows, half hidden by vines,
with the circular window seats; the same rosewood furniture.
In the center of one wall was the fireplace and on
either side the bookcases lined with the old textbooks and
his favorite volumes. Home again.</p>

<p>Robert arose, undressed and slipped into his bathrobe.
He walked about the room to verify the presence of certain
objects. Yes, even his class pipe was there. He removed
his wrist watch and laid it on the dressing table.
There would just be time enough for a shower.</p>

<p>His spirits rose under the stinging spray and he began
humming’ an old army tune:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

  </div>
</div>

<p>As he rubbed himself with a bath towel he thought:
“Mammy Chloe is right at that. I am pretty thin.” He
flexed his muscles and posed before the mirror. Not so
much thinner than when he had left home. He had gained
almost fifteen pounds in the army and lost it all and a
little more in the hospital. The scar was barely visible. He
remembered the wound that his grandfather had received in
the Civil War and wondered whether inquisitive children
would ever ask him to show his scar. He inspected his face
in the mirror. Not such a bad job for shaving on the train.
He threw on his bathrobe and returned to his room. In
the closet, carefully protected by a wardrobe bag hung his
dinner clothes, perfectly pressed. After he had dressed he
again stood before the mirror. Civilian clothes felt loose.
They felt as though he had forgotten to put something on.
They were careless, unrestrained, individualistic garments.</p>

<p>“Gee, but I wanna go home,” he sang.</p>

<p>When Captain Hamilton, in conventional dinner clothes,
reached the foot of the stairs it was to shock his mother
and Margaret.</p>

<p>“Wherever did you get those?” asked Margaret.</p>

<p>“Why, dear,” pleaded Mrs. Hamilton, “I thought you
would surely wear your uniform. A few friends are coming
over and I’m sure they would like to see you in uniform.”</p>

<p>Robert grinned.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know. I just thought it would be rather
nice to slip into these for a change. You know I’ve worn
olive-drab for two years now.”</p>

<p>“But they will want to see you in uniform,” urged his
mother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span></p>

<p>“And Howard is going to be here and I do want him to
see you in uniform. He’s going to wear his,” added Margaret.</p>

<p>“Which is all the more reason why I shouldn’t. Anyway
my uniform’s too hot, and my gabardine is in the trunk.”</p>

<p>But Mrs. Hamilton triumphantly pointed to the fact that
George had just returned from another trip to the depot
with Robert’s locker trunks and would carry them up in
another minute, and Captain Hamilton was forced to turn
back and resume the habiliments of war. But he did it
happily. The last time, he thought.</p>

</div>

<p>Howard Pinkney did come, as Margaret had predicted,
and, as she had likewise predicted, he wore his captain’s
uniform. He made some sort of explanation. He was
either coming from an affair or going to one which all the
officers of the home guards were to attend or had attended,
and there was no time left for changing into “civies.” He
was very apologetic about it and very effulgent in his praise
of the returning captain.</p>

<p>Hamilton’s dislike for Pinkney was reborn. He had
disliked him in childhood because Howard had rosy <span class="lock">cheeks—</span>an
unforgivable offense in a boy. He had punched his
nose for that reason many, many years ago, although the
announced reason was that Pinkney “was too darned
smart.” And having harmed him for no legitimate reason,
he naturally disliked him still more. Pinkney, however, in
spite of Robert’s opinion, had turned out disappointingly
successful. He had stepped out of college into a large
lumber firm, showed a precocious grasp of business principles
and within two years had been made vice-president.
During the war he had made his spectacular coup of cornering
most of the available Southern walnut used in
fashioning rifle stocks.</p>

<p>For a young man he had a peculiarly <span class="lock">set—</span>Hamilton
called it “ossified”—mind. He accepted traditional ideas
as firmly as do men of twice his years and without youth’s
questioning of them. In business he had a whole set of
principles that Hamilton never knew existed. He had ideas
about the position of the South in industry and about the
South’s contribution to world commerce. Things that no
healthy young man would think twice about. Where Hamilton
would be interested in discussing a football game or
a play, Pinkney would discuss the extension of the federal
reserve system.</p>

<p>To Robert, business was a mere incident in life, a necessary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
evil whereby one provided one’s self with the means
of enriching and enjoying it. To Pinkney, business was
one of life’s essentials. He took it quite as seriously as
tennis or riding. A surprising fellow.</p>

<p>Tennis and riding he did <span class="lock">well—</span>efficiently—that was the
word. Just as he did everything else. It was part of his
physical life. He had <span class="lock">departments—</span>physical, mental, moral,
social, and all separated from each other like boxes in a
vault. In order to succeed one must give so much time and
effort to each of these divisions. One must play tennis or
take some other suitable form of exercise every day so as
to keep in trim for the more serious duties of life. When
Pinkney went for a walk, he didn’t say: “I’m going out to
commune with nature,” which is sentimental, but understandable,
or “I’m going along a picturesque road,” or simply
“I’m going for a walk,” but “I’m going to get an hour’s
exercise.”</p>

<p>He had an annoying way of keeping up with the times in
everything. He even subscribed to the New York Times
so that he might profit by the book reviews and bought the
volumes there recommended.</p>

<p>He attended church and the most important social functions
with regularity and was looked up to everywhere. He
was pointed out as an example of the Southern young man
in business. On public committees he frequently represented
the young business man. Nothing could keep him
from becoming in time president of his firm, a bank director,
president of the Chamber of Commerce and a college
trustee.</p>

<p>It was only characteristic that Howard Pinkney should
still aspire to Margaret’s hand long after she had chosen
Robert, and it was also characteristic of him that he should
neither show nor feel the slightest animosity towards his
successful rival. He treated him with all the charity that
he used toward a formidable business competitor.</p>

<p>Pinkney was undeniably handsome in his concentrated,
alert way. He was nearly as tall as Robert, slighter-framed
but heavier, with straight, light brown hair combed back<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
from a sloping forehead. His features were more regular,
less rugged than Robert’s and his gray eyes were intelligent
and intense. Hamilton noticed all this as Pinkney first entered
the room and wondered why Margaret had so often
rejected him in favor of himself. It was Howard’s only
failure.</p>

<p>Howard, as an officer of the home guard, somehow
supererogated to himself the function of reintroducing
Hamilton to his townsfolk.</p>

<p>“Judge, here is Captain Hamilton. Isn’t he looking splendid
after his harassing experiences in France? We must
have him recount them to us some evening at the club.
Lieutenant <span class="lock">Brownlow—</span>Mr. Brownlow is one of the lieutenants
in the guards. He was exempt because of fallen
<span class="lock">arches—</span>Lieutenant Brownlow has been longing to see you
and I have taken the liberty of inviting him. Of course
he knows all about your splendid exploits. Mr. Jarvis, our
hero has come back again. Have you a card with you?
We must bring him into the Trick Track Tribe. Yes, here
it is. Thank you. Give it to me when you have filled it
out.”</p>

<p>Hamilton slipped the card into his pocket without reading
it. He was becoming tired of meeting so many people. He
had always looked forward to his home coming as to an
opportunity for unlimited rest. And here he was in the
midst of a buzz of many conversations, shaking hands, answering
a hundred questions, standing up, moving around
to different groups, always smiling. Of course, he understood,
this was his first night at home. One had to sacrifice
one’s self to the duties of society. But he heartily
wished that it was over. He wished, above all, that the
home guard would suddenly mobilize for some reason and
that Pinkney would be called out.</p>

<p>In Paris he had enjoyed the salons, the stimulating exchange
of ideas; but in his own home he wished to be alone
with his parents, and perhaps with Margaret. His parents,
he perceived, were probably wishing the same thing. They
kept throwing little smiles at him and to each other and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
Mrs. Hamilton kept coming over to squeeze his hand.
How beautiful his mother really must have been when she
was, say, Margaret’s age. He loved her soft gray hair.
And how distinguished his father looked, with his immaculate
moustache and goatee.</p>

<p>Robert moved to a little group of men who were discussing
some subject animatedly and sat down.</p>

<p>“There’s only one solution for this problem,” the fat,
bald-headed little man, who had been introduced to him as
Mr. Jarvis, was saying, “and that’s Americanization.”</p>

<p>“Americanization?” It was Pinkney’s father speaking,
a heavy moustached man, with hawk-like <span class="lock">features—</span>Howard
“took after” his mother. “Americanization? What they
need is a good dose of tar and feathers. Yes, sir, good old
tar and feathers. What do you think about it, Captain
Hamilton?” He leaned forward in his chair.</p>

<p>“What is that?” asked Robert.</p>

<p>“Those damned foreigners,” the older Pinkney drawled.
“The niggers are bad enough. But now these damned foreigners
are getting too strong here.”</p>

<p>Mr. Pinkney was the sort of man who never referred to
foreigners, save as “damned foreigners,” nor to women
without adding “God bless ’em.”</p>

<p>“Do you know what some of those Jews are doing? Yes,
sir, let me tell you! They’re bringing business up Telfair
Avenue. When my father built there, yes, sir, it was the
finest district in Corinth. He thought he’d leave it for his
children and his children’s children. Never thought the
town would grow to it. Now, sir, just take a drive past the
place. I had to sell it three years ago. What are they
doing? Putting up apartments, yes, sir, apartments.”</p>

<p>He looked fiercely at Hamilton as if to see whether Robert
could possibly have any sympathy with a foreigner who
put up apartment buildings.</p>

<p>“Five years ago that Jew real estate man, Abrams, came
to me. Said it was inevitable that business must expand
and that it would march up Telfair Avenue. Said he was
negotiating for some leases there and advised me to convert<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
my property into something that would pay. Pay, sir, pay!
I told him that my father hadn’t built his house to pay, but
to live in. Ha, Ha!”</p>

<p>Jarvis and Pinkney and the other gentlemen laughed.</p>

<p>“That’s a good one, all right,” said Jarvis.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, live in. Well, he said that as the lower part
of Telfair Avenue became a business section, the value of
the upper part would fall because it would lose its exclusiveness.
And he advised me to tear down the home or at least
remodel it into an apartment building, and move out in
Fairview. Said he was moving there himself.”</p>

<p>Pinkney looked about sharply and paused a moment to
accentuate the effect of the denouement of the incident.</p>

<p>“What did I tell him? I said, ‘So you’re moving out
to Fairview? Well, that’s every reason in the world why
<em>I shouldn’t</em>! Just like that, sir. Shut him up, right off,
like that.’”</p>

<p>“That’s the way to fix ’em!” said Jarvis, nodding his
head.</p>

<p>“But wasn’t the real estate man right after all?” Hamilton
asked timidly after the laughter had subsided.
“Wasn’t it good advice?”</p>

<p>“Good advice? Why, if it weren’t for Abrams and his
kind Telfair Avenue would still be an exclusive residence
district. Yes, sir. Everybody else sold and moved out,
but I stuck to my property until they built up all around it.
When they tried to get my place I put up a stiff price. I
didn’t want ’em to come there in the first place with their
apartment houses and, if they wanted it bad enough I
thought they could pay for it. But the shrewd rascals
wouldn’t buy. They went ahead with their plans. Well,
sir, when I moved I offered the land at their price, but they
wouldn’t take it. No, sir, wouldn’t take it. We had some
words, and I told Abrams what I thought of him and the
Jerusalem he was bringing to Corinth.”</p>

<p>The older Pinkney went into a detailed and often vituperative
account of his real estate dealings, the upshot of
which was that the “damned Jew” wouldn’t buy, the Pinkney<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
property was sold piecemeal to other dealers for a song,
sold in turn to some other “damned Jew” and a large apartment
building erected.</p>

<p>Someone else capped the story with an account of how a
Jewish merchant was enlarging his department store, the
few original merchants whose fathers or grandfathers had
founded their businesses having been slowly forced out of
business by competition.</p>

<p>“You’ve been away so long, young sir,” said Mr. Pinkney,
“that you don’t realise what’s been happening here.
But we’ve got something to remedy that. Yes, sir, remedy
it. It’s the good old remedy of tar applied externally with
a lot of feathers. It cured the carpetbaggers after the War
and it’ll cure the niggers and foreigners now. Maybe Howard
has told you something about it. My son has been up
against un-Americanism here while you were fighting the
enemy over in France. And he’s one of the leaders in reviving
the Trick Track Tribe.”</p>

<p>Mr. Forsythe, Margaret’s father, a gray, small man of
uncertain gestures and opinions, darted him a swift look.
He had greeted Hamilton previously with a subdued
warmth, which had puzzled his prospective son-in-law.</p>

<p>“Is it?” he was going to say ‘safe,’ thought better of it,
“that is, does he know?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, he’ll be one of us. We’re all Trick Tracks
here, aren’t we? Jarvis has given Robert an application
card. Ordinarily we wouldn’t use the name, but Robert’s
all right. Yes, sir. We all know where he stands.”</p>

<p>Reassured, Mr. Forsythe spoke about Mill Town, a
suburb which had sprung up during the war for the housing
of workers in Corinth factories.</p>

<p>“You don’t appreciate this, young man,” he began.
“When our supply of labor ran low meeting war orders, we
tried an experiment, brought a few foreign laborers from
Baltimore through an agency. Now we’re sorry we did it.
We paid them high wages and they settled down with their
families. There’s quite a colony of them now. They’re a
vicious lot. They wouldn’t stand for a cut of wages after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
the armistice, because, they said, prices hadn’t come down
yet. And they actually had the audacity to insist on our
continuing to recognise the union.”</p>

<p>“It’s the same all over. All over. Yes, sir,” Mr. Pinkney
cut in. “But we’ll crush the unions. They’ve no place
in a free government. They’re un-American.”</p>

<p>“Un-American” was one of the most frequent words in
Mr. Pinkney’s vocabulary and it took the place of argument.
It was enough to call a thing un-American to condemn it
immediately. Thus he never said that labor unions are a
bad thing because they interfere with freedom of contract,
or because they tend to form a monopoly of labor under the
control of a few men, or because they engender class consciousness.
He never raised arguments, even bad arguments,
against them! They were simply un-American.</p>

<p>Socialism was not even discussable, because it “bore the
stamp ‘Made in Germany,’” and was moreover the theory
of a Jew. It was so un-American that its mere mention
caused him to turn purple with rage. And having decided
that Socialism was un-American, there was a whole category
of other institutions that were tabooed as Socialistic.
He had viewed with alarm the control by the government
of the railroads during the war, “because it was Socialistic.”
He never argued that it expedited or delayed the transportation
of men and materials to the sea-board. He never
argued that it raised or lowered freight rates. He never
argued that it increased or lowered the morale of the workers.
He never argued that it aided or hindered the financial
condition of the roads. Not he. No, sir. With a single
word he knocked down the fallacy of all government
ownership. It was socialistic.</p>

<p>Foreign language papers were <i lang="la">per se</i> un-American and
the use of a foreign language an open insult. No matter
whether the offender had been imported into this country
only a few years before, had been working too hard in
the steel or textile mills to learn English and was gaining
his conceptions of Americanism through the foreign papers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
and in a foreign tongue, or whether he had lived in this
country thirty years. It was un-American.</p>

<p>Un-American, Hamilton perceived, as Mr. Pinkney rattled
on, were the meetings of labor unions and the speeches
made there. Mr. Pinkney had <em>not</em> attended them, the idea,
sir, and he had no intention of doing so, but he knew
that no good could come of them. Drinking in a saloon
as the foreigners did and drinking beer with their meals
were un-American, although partaking of beverages in one’s
club or drawing room was proper. The graduated income
tax with its damnable surtaxes was confiscatory, Socialistic
and un-American. The tariff, except on cotton, certain
kinds of lumber and a few articles in which he was interested,
was un-American. Even the Republican party
was a party of nigger-lovers and foreigners, an un-American
institution, foisted on the nation by the North and to
which no gentleman of standing belonged.</p>

<p>Mr. Pinkney’s tirade amused Hamilton. It was what
he had heard in his father’s drawing room and at his
club before the war, only stronger than ever. The war
had liberalized his own ideas, but evidently it had increased
the conservatism of those who had remained at home. He
had accepted the Germans for the time being as a foe, but
as a worthy foe and one to be treated according to ideas
of chivalry traditional with white civilization. Here they
held an exaggerated hatred for things not only German, but
even foreign. Hamilton recalled with a smile Levin’s description
of the hundred per centers who remained at
home and refused to eat German fried potatoes.</p>

<p>In Paris, too, he had heard Socialism discussed on every
hand. He was not a Socialist. The persons who discussed
it were divided in their opinions. Some were bitter opponents.
Others were ardent supporters. Still others believed
in a modified Socialistic program. It was the same
way with other <span class="lock">ideas—</span>with Bolshevism, with the League
of Nations, with post-impressionism, with <i lang="fr">vers libre</i>. Men
and women discussed these subjects animatedly on both,
sides; but he had never heard anyone condemn an institution<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
or an idea simply because it was un-French or condemn
the discussion of it.</p>

<p>Of course, Paris had its Bourbons, but even they did
not seem quite so intolerant.</p>

<p>In Paris, in fact, he had witnessed an excess of <span class="lock">liberality—</span>in
morals, in art, in literature, as well as in political
philosophy. It had even made Hamilton uncomfortable.
He felt that in contrast Mr. Pinkney’s philosophy was
sound. It had, at least, the soundness of <span class="lock">conservatism—</span>the
unwillingness to change what time has proved to be
good, for the new and untried. There was no danger that
a city of Pinkneys would ever tolerate any of the shocking
spectacles that he had seen in the Paris concert halls.
There was no danger that a city of Pinkneys would ever
hold ideas of free love. It was inconceivable that any
Pinkney would ever aid in razing a bastile or setting up
a commune or a system of soviets. It was inconceivable
even that a state of Pinkneys would attempt to operate
public cotton mills, as some Socialistic western state was
trying to operate grain elevators. Pinkney was certainly
safe and <span class="lock">sane—</span>so insanely sane. Come what might he
would forget nothing of his principles of Americanism.
And would never learn anything.</p>

<p>Hamilton mildly expressed the view that practically every
inhabitant of the United States was as American as even
Mr. Pinkney would have him. The exceptions were so
few that one could disregard them. But the holding of
a different opinion on political, economic or even social
questions did not at all interfere with their Americanism.
If the opinion was wrong, full discussion of it, even a
little experimentation of certain theories, would prove them
wrong.</p>

<p>“A lie must fall of its own weight,” said Hamilton.</p>

<p>“But we’ll help push it over,” said the younger Pinkney
coming up at this point, “won’t we dad? And we need
men like you, Captain Hamilton, to help us. There are
abuses that must be corrected. The Negro must be kept
in his place. The supremacy of the white man must be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
maintained. The Constitution of the United States must
be upheld. Unwarranted strikes must be prevented. Law
and order must prevail.”</p>

<p>It was rather pompous nonsense, Hamilton thought.
Certainly, law and order should prevail and unwarranted
strikes be prevented and the Constitution upheld. As for
the Negro, of course he must remain in his place. But
what was his place? Two years ago he would have said
that the Negro’s place was on the plantation and in the
less skilled classes of labor exclusively. In Paris he had
been ready to defend that theory fiercely. Now he was not
so sure. He remembered the reception where Williams had
been received on even terms with the white guests and
he wondered what would happen should Williams suddenly
walk into the room. Out of the corner of his eye he noticed
Margaret approaching with refreshments of some
kind.</p>

<p>Neither Chlorabelle nor Chlorine had appeared that evening.
Ordinarily they would have distributed the trays.
Instead, Mrs. Hamilton, assisted by Margaret, was performing
that service. Mammy Chloe and George were
the only servants visible and they, from time to time, appeared
with plates of sandwiches or cakes or ices or to
renew the punch bowl.</p>

<p>Hamilton listened impatiently to Pinkney.</p>

<p>“When I was in Paris,” he began, “I saw something that
I suppose would have shocked you all. It was at a reception,
one of a number that I attended in the Champs Elysées.
The hostess, the Countess Montfort....”</p>

<p>Hamilton went on to describe the reception.</p>

<p>“And who do you think was the center of attraction?
Not any Frenchman, nor any of the foreign generals or
<span class="lock">ambassadors—</span>but a Negro officer!”</p>

<p>Mr. Jarvis puffed out his cheeks.</p>

<p>“Horrible! Horrible!”</p>

<p>Mr. Forsythe shook his head vaguely. The elder Pinkney
looked as though he had barely escaped swallowing his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
moustache. His son clenched his fists and puffed out his
chest importantly.</p>

<p>“Really not,” exclaimed Margaret. “I hope you didn’t
stay there.”</p>

<p>“No,” he replied, “I didn’t. I flew into a rage, said
something that I’m afraid might have been misconstrued as
rude and left.”</p>

<p>The Pinkneys uttered their approval and the others
added their smaller voices.</p>

<p>“Splendid! That was exactly what I should have done!”
declared Margaret, her brown eyes blazing. She looked
like a reincarnation of Dixie <span class="lock">aroused—</span>lithe, beautiful, impassioned.</p>

<p>“But,” Hamilton gulped. He was aware that he was
about to spoil the tableau. Of course he realised that he
might explain that Williams had saved his life, which would
make his feelings excusable. But why should he do that?
The fact that a colored man had or had not rescued him
really ought not to affect their attitude. He would not tell
them. “But,” said Hamilton, “the queer thing about it was
that later I felt ashamed of myself. Not right away, but a
few days later. I felt ashamed that I, as an American, as
an officer in an army which had gone over there with the
avowed purpose of making the world safe for democracy,
had held that attitude to another American, to a brother
officer in the same army.” Hamilton watched Margaret’s
face turn pale and then red and her eyes fall in embarrassment,
but he went on. “I felt ashamed that of all the
people there, representatives of every race and nation, that
an American should have been the only one to express so
un-American an attitude.”</p>

<p>He warmed to his subject as he noticed his hearers exchange
uneasy glances. His mother, too, had come up to
look for him, and he noticed her in a little fringe of guests
who had been attracted by the discussion. She was
listening.</p>

<p>“It isn’t as though I don’t think my race the finest on
earth,” he went on. “But it seems that in some things we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
haven’t always been <span class="lock">just—</span>haven’t lived up to that high
standard that we ought to maintain. To the outside world
we have proclaimed our democratic ideals, our moral support
of the different people of Europe in obtaining representative
government. Have we been as just to our own
<span class="lock">citizens—</span>to the Negro?”</p>

<p>Hamilton’s father looked surprised and tugged at his
moustache.</p>

<p>“Robert doesn’t mean exactly what <span class="lock">he—</span>m’m, <span class="lock">a—</span>implies,”
he offered a verbal straw at which his son might grasp.
“Perhaps in some places the Negro isn’t accorded, what
shall I say, kindness, or, perhaps better, human treatment.
But not here in our city.”</p>

<p>Young Pinkney threw out a life preserver.</p>

<p>“There’s something in what Robert has said. I find that
you can get more out of a Negro if you treat him considerately.
For instance, in one of our lumber mills we
found that the Negroes work best when they are allowed to
sing. For a time we made them work quietly, but we found
by a series of tests that they actually did more work when
permitted to sing, so we reinstituted the custom and our
output rose nearly 10 per cent.”</p>

<p>“Nobody in the South really mistreats the coon,” put in
Jarvis, shaking his head. “In the North, maybe, where
they don’t understand his nature. But not in the South.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Hamilton looked appealingly at him. Margaret still
stared at the floor, but Hamilton could no more stop himself
than he could that night in Paris.</p>

<p>“No,” he said. “That’s not what I mean at all. Only a
brute treats human beings cruelly. I don’t mean to say
<span class="lock">you—</span>we—that most of us do that. But I do mean to say
that perhaps we haven’t given him a fair chance. We
don’t let him vote, and we complain that he’s not a loyal
citizen. We don’t provide equal educational facilities for
him with the white child, and we complain that he’s ignorant.
We don’t give him a fair trial in our courts and we
accuse him of being a criminal. We crowd him off our
sidewalks, we make him sit in Jim Crow cars, we treat him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
like a dog, and we complain that he’s less than the highest
type of human <span class="lock">being—</span>and in Paris, the cream of European
society shaking hands with a colored man and listening to
him sing.”</p>

<p>There was a sound of clearing throats. Margaret turned
her eyes from one side of the circle to the other, but there
was no escape. The Hamiltons looked self-consciously at
each other.</p>

<p>“Well, those Parisians,” began Mr. Forsythe in a small
voice, as if his impending relationship with Robert made it
incumbent upon him to say something that would relieve
the tension; but young Pinkney, with a swift glance toward
Margaret, took up the cudgels for white supremacy and
the South.</p>

<p>“The French,” he began in his confidential manner, as
though the French were the Smiths who lived in the next
block, “the French, as you know, Robert, hardly ever see a
Negro. He’s a novelty to them. The Frenchman invites
him to his receptions just <span class="lock">as—</span>as a New York society
woman might have an ape at a dinner. He sees only the
Negro in a million with a gift for poetry or <span class="lock">writing—</span>and
he’s never full-blooded. He has not seen the masses.” His
voice suddenly became intense. “He hasn’t lived where
there are three blacks for every white and breeding faster
every year; where his whole white civilization is trembling
on a foundation of lazy, ignorant, dirty, diseased, unruly
niggers.</p>

<p>“You say, give them the vote. Give it to them, and they’ll
fill every office in the state in time and make and enforce
the laws that govern white men. For it’s only a matter of
time when they’ll be outnumbering us in every locality
throughout the South, only a matter of more time when
they’ll be controlling politics throughout the country.</p>

<p>“Let them sit on the benches of our courts, and they’ll
dispossess us of our property and our rights. Give them
higher education, and they’ll become dissatisfied with their
lot and revolt. Take away your Jim Crow cars, let them
into the hotels and restaurants, and they’ll enter the club<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
and the home. Bring them into the home, give them social
equality, wipe cut the anti-marriage laws, and they’ll drag
the white race down to their stinking level. Cruel are we?—unjust?
Remember there’s only one crime for which a
nigger is ever lynched in the South.</p>

<p>“I’ve been brought up by a Negro mammy and our
family’s had colored servants. They stuck to us through
the Civil War and after. There is a place for that kind of
<span class="lock">nigger—</span>the good nigger, the nigger who knows his level
and keeps it, the nigger who respects white authority and
white supremacy. To him the Southerner’s heart is always
open. He’ll find him the best friend in the world. But
there’s no place for the smart nigger, the white-collared
nigger, the nigger who wants what he calls equal rights.</p>

<p>“What does France or, for that matter, the North, know
about the colored man? We here, in defense of white
supremacy, pure womanhood and law and order, know that
we have to make the nigger walk the mark. We know that
the strong arm of <span class="lock">justice—</span>but the white man’s justice, with
bullet, noose and torch, if need <span class="lock">be—</span>is the one thing that
will keep this country from being overrun by an inferior
race. It is a case of ruling or being ruled. We have had
our experience, a brief one, at being ruled, by niggers and
carpetbaggers after the war. We’re through.</p>

<p>“Maybe you don’t know what the colored races are doing?
Japan coming into the conference on equal terms with the
great Christian nations. The Hindus revolting. The Turks
ready to strike back at the white nations which have shut
her back into Asia, where she belongs, and spreading the
doctrine of Islam throughout the brown and the black
world of Asia and Africa. And now the same thing in
America. The colored races outnumber us. Only our
brains, our ability to rule, by word and by sword, keeps
us on top. But let us once relax our grip, let the nigger
only make the United States the mulatto paradise of which
he dreams, and the agitator and nigger lover will wish to
God he’d never started. The Red, the Yellow, the Brown<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
and the Black people, outnumbering us ten to one, will rise
like a black <span class="lock">wave—</span>dark water, that’s <span class="lock">it—</span>and sweep the
white world away.”</p>

<p>Hamilton sat flushed and conscious of the glances directed
at him. Pinkney had addressed all his remarks to Robert,
as though he were the attacker of the white race and himself
the defender. Robert was not particularly keen for an
argument, especially with a guest in his own house, for the
discussion had grown into that now and threatened to become
even more heated. He noticed that Margaret’s eyes
were intent upon Pinkney. He was tired from traveling
and wished to be alone. Confound these receptions anyway!
Why didn’t Pinkney change the subject or yield the
floor to someone else? A score of answers came to him.
He wondered what Dorothy was doing. He fell to comparing
her with Margaret.</p>

<p>He was conscious of murmuring a few hazy affirmations
or denials to Pinkney, while his mind was somewhere else.
“Well, perhaps”; or “I don’t know about that.” He heard
some one making <span class="lock">apologies—</span>not exactly apologies, but
speaking about his services overseas and complimenting
him. They were saying that he was all right anyway and
that he was simply taking a side for an argument. Pinkney
was still talking. Margaret was still hanging on to his
words. He was quoting Du Bois. He was telling Hamilton
to read him. He was telling him about diverse threats
against the peace of the white world by more or less responsible
writers of color. He was quoting Japanese militarists
and Hindu pacifists as well as Georgia blacks.</p>

<p>“No, we need you, Hamilton, Captain Hamilton, in the
fight for a higher and purer Americanism,” Pinkney was
saying. “We need your type to carry on our fight for white
supremacy, for the protection of pure womanhood”—his
eyes were flashing proudly at Margaret. Hamilton was
watching his little gestures without catching all the words.
But for some time the circle had broken up into smaller
groups and now Pinkney was simply inviting Robert to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
see him in his office at his earliest convenience. There
was an arrangement he wished to discuss which might prove
profitable.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, of course,” said Hamilton, “I’ll drop in,”
although he wondered how Pinkney could possibly discuss
a profitable arrangement of any kind with him.</p>

</div>

<p>Becoming reacquainted with the family and the city was
an adventure. During his absence, he noted, the help had
been cut down to Mammy Chloe and George. With Virginia
Ruth living in New Orleans and himself away from
home, the wants of the Hamiltons were really very simple,
in spite of their standing in society. They had given up
all the horses but one and had kept only the touring car.</p>

<p>“We don’t need much and it simplifies things,” Mr. Hamilton
had explained. “You see, your mother is getting,
well, is getting to the point where she wishes to be free from
the responsibilities of managing a large household and we
have even been considering selling the <span class="lock">house—</span>we’ve been
offered a good <span class="lock">price—</span>and renting an apartment.”</p>

<p>Renting an apartment? What a dismal outlook. Robert
detested apartments. They were all right in New York,
but in the South! He wanted <span class="lock">room—</span>room to loaf about
and read, room for riding and playing tennis, room to entertain
his friends. The tennis court, he noticed, had been
allowed to run down and he decided to have it put back in
shape the first chance he got.</p>

<p>In the meantime there were so many old friends to visit,
so many questions to answer. On the first night home, a
reporter from the morning paper had <span class="lock">come—</span>it was almost
<span class="lock">midnight—</span>to interview him, and the reporters from the
afternoon papers had followed the next day. They had
asked not merely questions about his personal experiences,
but questions of which he knew nothing. About the peace
conference, about the League of Nations. What did the
French think of President Wilson and of Americans in
general? Who won the war? And what part did the
Southern, and particularly the Georgian, troops play in the
war? Of course, he had been with New York troops, but
he generously accorded the Southern soldiers their full<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
meed of praise, which they doubtlessly deserved anyway,
and of which he had heard indirectly.</p>

<p>And Margaret? He had to become acquainted with her
all over again, too. She seemed younger than before he
had left her to go to France. It was not alone her dress.
He noticed that the women were wearing short skirts in
imitation of the Parisiennes. It was not alone in her manner
of combing her hair. It lay in a childish freshness
that was at once impudent and sophisticated. Margaret had
never been a serious-minded young lady, but now she
seemed fairly to flutter above the realities of life.</p>

<p>They were returning from a dance one evening, at which
Robert had incurred Margaret’s displeasure by attempting
to sit out most of his dances. It was almost two o’clock and
they were driving down a deserted street. Before the war,
midnight had generally been the limit for a dance, unless
it was some exceptional occasion, like the annual charity
ball, for instance.</p>

<p>“You know, you <span class="lock">seem—</span>you seem so much younger than
when I left,” said Robert.</p>

<p>“Oh, do I?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And I suppose you don’t like it. You’d want me to
stay home every evening and darn socks and go to bed at
nine, I suppose. What’s the matter with you, Bob? We
used to be such good pals. Don’t, don’<span class="lock">t—</span>oh, I don’t know.”</p>

<p>They drove on in silence. How could he explain things
to her? How could he make her understand his feelings?
He wished, in a way, that he had postponed their engagement,
not that they wouldn’t marry eventually anyway, but
that it placed him under obligations. He had to escort her
to dances and receptions and take her to the theatre. Of
course, he got a certain amount of pleasure out of these
things, but then he preferred simply to loaf about the house.
It was queer, a fellow lay in the mud in Flanders for months
under a drizzling sky and dreamed of coming home. Home
was pre-eminently a place for loafing. A place where one
could sleep as late as one wanted, lounge about in old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
clothes and sleep some more. Now that one finally did
reach home, one found that practise did not square with
theory. Theoretically, Hamilton could have stayed in bed
all morning. But when his parents were at the breakfast
table at eight o’clock, he felt under a moral obligation to do
likewise, especially now that the burden of housework had
fallen on the shoulders of a single servant. Theoretically,
too, he could have retired at eight every evening or stayed
up until three in the morning, but practically, there were
always social duties to perform. Margaret was always calling
him up and claiming him.</p>

<p>There was no use trying to explain a thing like that to
Margaret. How could she understand? She would probably
think that he was getting old. He was only twenty-six.
Had the war aged him? He had always taken Pinkney for
a prematurely aged young man, and yet, while Pinkney was
able to talk business and finances with the elders of the city,
he was able to cut a commanding figure in the younger
social set. He knew all the latest steps and even introduced
little variations that he had picked up in New Orleans,
Charleston and Baltimore.</p>

<p>With Dorothy, he reflected, he could sit idly at a table or
walk along the street and express his <span class="lock">thoughts—</span>he had need
to express them to some one. He wished, too, that Margaret
did not so openly disapprove of what he had said in
defense of the Negro that evening at his home. For a
woman, anyway, he would have preferred that Margaret
take the more humane point of view. He was old-fashioned
enough to believe that a woman should display the softer
virtues.</p>

<p>“What are you thinking about?” Margaret pouted
coquettishly. “You haven’t said a word to me for five
minutes, excepting monosyllables.”</p>

<p>“Oh, a lot of things. I—”</p>

<p>“Well, you mustn’t. That’s a bad habit. You should
live instead of thinking about it. See ‘how sweet the moonlight
sleeps upon this bank.’”</p>

<p>Margaret’s mood could change from the colloquial to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
the mock poetic in a moment. When she quoted poetry it
was with a little exaggerated air, as though she were pretending
to act.</p>

<p>“‘Eat thou and drink,’” she quoted grandiloquently,
“‘tomorrow thou shalt die.’ That’s what Howard recites
to me sometimes. Don’t you think that’s right?”</p>

<p>“Yes, perhaps it is, but it’s only one point of view.
Rossetti, you know, wrote three sonnets, each giving a different
viewpoint, and that is only one of them.”</p>

<p>“Oh, is that so? Anyway, I think it’s very beautiful.
Don’t you?”</p>

<p>Margaret relapsed into her poetic mood. She would ask
Robert if he had heard this or that and then recite it with
her coquettishly exaggerated emotion. It was very delightful
on the whole. If she wished to sit closer to him, too,
or hold his hand she could do it in play, as though it were
part of the gestures accompanying the recitation. Some of
the poems she quoted, Robert thought splendid, but others
were sentimental bits that she had picked up from the fillers
in the evening newspaper. She would quote, almost in the
same breath with Shakespeare, the rhymed imbecilities of a
syndicate humorist whose chief contribution to poesy was
his method of arranging the lines so that they were separated
by little asterisks and so that one had to read from
the bottom line to the top. Probably otherwise nobody
would ever read the stuff. The announced object of arranging
the lines from bottom to top was to get the reader
in the habit of always looking upward and onward to higher
things, the highest thing being the rhymster’s signature, Milt
Elkron, on the very pinnacle.</p>

<p>There were quarter hours, too, when Margaret would
discuss “books,” that is, fiction. Here, too, she would speak
of O. Henry, Henry James and James Branch Cabell with
indiscriminate enthusiasm, although the first of the three
was the only one of whom she had really read more than
one volume.</p>

<p>“I didn’t like Wells’ last book. It was very disappointing.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
Not much plot. Too heavy. But Harold Bell Wright
has a corking story. It’s just like life!”</p>

<p>Robert liked Margaret’s make-believe mood, during which
she pretended to be giving expression to some inner spirit
through the medium of verse. Pretense, after all, was
something. And she pretended without in the least attempting
to deceive. It was just a game. Of course, she expected
him to return her little sallies with others in kind or
with graceful, flowery compliments, which he could do skilfully.
For instance, if she, coming to a dark spot in the
road, and letting go of his arm, suddenly cried: “Thou
know’st the wash of night is on my face, else would a
maiden blush bepaint my cheek,” he would reply: “Lady,
by yonder blessed moon, I swear”—or something about
Stygian darkness, and they would both laugh.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you ever write poetry?” asked Margaret, as
they stopped before her house. “I think you ought to
write something splendid. I have a trade-last for you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, have you? What is it? I’m all ears.”</p>

<p>“But you must tell me one first,” she pouted.</p>

<p>That struck him as another one of her childish absurdities.</p>

<p>“Oh, <span class="lock">I—</span>a—know some one who thinks you’re the prettiest
girl in Corinth.”</p>

<p>“Do you? Who’s that?”</p>

<p>“Guess?”</p>

<p>“Can’t.”</p>

<p>“Try.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t, it isn’t you? Oh, that isn’t fair? You just
made that up!”</p>

<p>“Oh, but it is though. Of course, I think you’re the
prettiest girl in Corinth.”</p>

<p>He caught her in his arms and kissed her to prove it.</p>

<p>“Has to be some one else! Has to be some one else!”
Margaret insisted, with fascinating mock childishness.</p>

<p>“Well, then,” Robert thought a moment, “it’s Howard
Pinkney. Now are you satisfied?”</p>

<p>She shook her head, with a little smile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span></p>

<p>“No. That’s just as bad. He tells me that himself every
time I see him. But I’ll tell you anyway.”</p>

<p>The compliment was a minor one. Some elderly, romantic
woman, whom Robert dimly remembered, had thought
he looked like a <span class="lock">poet—</span>like a picture she had of Rupert
<span class="lock">Brooke—</span>a far-fetched likeness.</p>

<p>“And now,” Margaret was standing at the door, her head
thrown back, her eyes shining like dark stars:</p>

<p>Her make-believe mood again. She was playing at being
in love. She blew him a tantalizing kiss before the illusion
had time to die, and disappeared into the house. Robert
stood there for a moment. He realised that Margaret was
only playing, that she had probably learned the <span class="lock">words—</span>yes,
he even remembered where she had learned <span class="lock">them—</span>while
taking the rôle of Juliet in her senior class play.
Still the objective world was a series of illusions. What
matter what Margaret was thinking or feeling within that
pretty little head if she could always create such illusions.
If she could always create them. He walked slowly back
to his car. A cloud momentarily obscured the moon. The
shadowy world of silver turned to black and then back to
silver. If she could always do that.</p>

<p>In his room he found his official orders where he had
stacked them on the chifferobe two days ago. He had
forgotten to sort them. He yawned and began undressing
leisurely. His hand brushed against the documents and he
paused to stack them up again. Here was a copy of the
telegram appointing him a second lieutenant in the Officers
Reserve Corps, the order directing him to appear at Camp
Eustis, the order assigning him to his company. And what
was that scribbled across one of the envelopes? A poem.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>It sounded familiar. He read on to the end:</p>

<p>He suddenly remembered. Dorothy. McCall. McCall
had scribbled the poem on an old envelope. Robert remembered
lending it to <span class="lock">him—</span>in the hospital. <span class="lock">But—</span>yes, he had
been right all the time. By a sort of instinct. He undressed,
turned off the lights and raised the shades. The
moonlight lay like a river of silver across the shadowy
lawn. A world of illusion and of beauty. Tomorrow,
he said, he would ask Margaret to set the day. They
should be married as quickly as possible.</p>

</div>

<p>The next morning Robert awoke only after he had been
called three times. The sun was shining brightly into his
window and he realized that it was past the family breakfast
hour. He lay in bed thinking of what he would do,
found that he was still in bed and stretched leisurely. As
long as he was late for breakfast he might as well be still
later. He suddenly remembered his resolve to see Margaret
and induce her to set their wedding as soon as
possible.</p>

<p>Of course, he could not with propriety visit her this
morning, after having seen her only a few hours before.
He would wait until afternoon. In the meantime he must
straighten those papers.</p>

<p>As his eyes fell upon the old envelope again he had an
impulse to tear it, another to send it to McCall, and a
third, which he followed, to keep it with his other records.
He would keep it with certain other letters, as a woman
might keep old rose <span class="lock">petals—</span>not to bloom again, but to
remind one of the past.</p>

<p>He noticed a card, which he had at first mistaken for
the postal ordering him to report at Plattsburg. Now he
saw it was a white card with the words “Non Silba Sed
Anthra” in large letters on the top line. “Non Silba Sed
Anthra?” Where had that come from? Let’s see. That
was Latin. Anyway, he knew what two of the words
meant. He went to the bookcase and pulled out his Latin
dictionary. There it was.</p>

<p>Now he remembered. That fat man had given it to
him. Oh, yes, Jarvis. He picked up the card and read it:</p>

<p>“Sir, six thousand men who are preparing for eventualities
have their eyes upon you. You are being weighed in
the balance!</p>

<p>“The Call is coming! Are you able and qualified to
respond?</p>

<p>“Discuss this matter with no one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span></p>

<p class="right">
“Oohay-Oohay-Oopay.”
</p>

<p>It seemed rather ridiculous, some sort of a practical joke,
until he remembered the society with an equally ridiculous
<span class="lock">name—</span>Trick Track <span class="lock">Tribe—</span>of which Jarvis and the Pinkneys
had spoken. The society that was to protect the white
race, womanhood, the United States Constitution and several
other things. That reminded Robert that he had promised
Howard Pinkney to see him.</p>

<p>Before his plate Robert found two letters. The one
with the Chicago postmark he opened first and read over
his oatmeal. Mrs. Hamilton came in and sat opposite,
although she had long since eaten her breakfast.</p>

<p>“Oh, mother,” he exclaimed, “a letter from Bill McCall!”</p>

<p>“One of your college friends?”</p>

<p>“No. He’s the man I’ve been telling you about. Don’t
you know? That Chicago newspaper man!”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, it’s too bad that he doesn’t live in Corinth.”</p>

<p>“I’ve never really told you or dad all that he’s done
for me.”</p>

<p>He laid the letter to one side and looked grave.</p>

<p>“He’s going to have an <span class="lock">operation—</span>a serious <span class="lock">operation—</span>on
his eye. It’s going to take place tomorrow morning and
he writes about it as though it were a joke!”</p>

<p>“Well, dear, maybe it’s not so serious as you think.
Surgeons can do such marvelous things nowadays. Don’t
you think you’d better finish your breakfast? Did he get
it in the war?”</p>

<p>Robert nodded.</p>

<p>“Yes. I never told you the details. I was afraid it
<span class="lock">might—</span>upset you, but Bill was wounded while trying to
save me.”</p>

<p>Briefly he sketched the account of his rescue, minimizing
as much as possible the danger to himself. His mother
covered her face with her hands.</p>

<p>“If I had known it at the time I couldn’t have stood
it, Robert.”</p>

<p>She took a seat beside him, placed her arm about his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
shoulders and rested her head against him. Mammy
Chloe’s dark face appeared for a moment in the swinging
door leading to the kitchen, a steaming plate of corn
fritters in her hand, but she did not enter. Robert took
his mother’s hand and was conscious of innumerable little
details of color and form.</p>

<p>“Just think,” he said, “not to be able to see anything!”
Not to be able to see, he thought, the sun gleaming through
a window and falling in bands of gold across the blue rug,
with tiny dust motes dancing in them. Not to see snowy
linen or shining silverware or glittering glass. Not to see
the warm glow of polished rosewood and the cheerful glow
of ivory woodwork. Not to see one’s mother or one’s
own face in the mirror. He shut his eyes for a moment.</p>

<p>“And to think that I can’t do anything,” he said at
length. “That I can’t even talk to him. And he writes
about ‘going over the top once more.’”</p>

<p>His mother tried to comfort him.</p>

<p>“I’m sure he’ll come through it all right,” she said. “It’s
too late to send him a letter, but you could send him a
telegram.”</p>

<p>“Yes.” Hamilton rose. “I must do that.” He took up
the second envelope mechanically and opened it. It was
a card like the one Jarvis had given him, with the same
heading: “Non Silba Sed Anthra” across the top. The
Latin annoyed him, the childish air of mystery, evidently
designed to impress persons who did not own Latin dictionaries.
There was the same silly signature, Oohay-Oohay-<span class="lock">Oopay—</span>pig
Latin, of course, for H. H. P., Howard Pinkney.
Who else would be asinine enough to think of it?
Another message, designed to be mysterious, followed the
heading:</p>

<p>“Sir:</p>

<p>“You have been weighed in the balance and found not
wanting!</p>

<p>“Strong <span class="lock">Men—</span>Brave Men (evidently Pinkney himself)—R-E-A-L
Men (probably little Jarvis). We need such
men. We know you are one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span></p>

<p>“The Bogeys of the Fourth Dimension will shortly issue
their call. Be discreet, preserve silence and bide the
coming.</p>

<p>“Discuss this matter with no one.</p>

<p class="right">
“Oohay-Oohay-Oopay.”
</p>

<p>Robert was thinking of McCall. The follow-up invitation
of the Trick Track Tribe jarred on him. He thrust
the card in his pocket and walked out to send his telegram.</p>

<p>As he walked toward his street car he offered little
prayers to a God whom he now realized he had invoked
all too seldom of late. He wondered why he should have
been saved and McCall chosen to undergo this ordeal.
And how would Dorothy take it? Would she be at his
bedside?</p>

<p>In Paris the operation had been accepted fatalistically
and in a spirit of bravado by both of them. That was because
it lay still so far in the future and, too, perhaps,
because they then still retained the war-time psychology,
the callous outlook upon life and death that frequent contact
with these had formed.</p>

<p>The car jolted and was dirty. The blacks, he noticed,
were squeezed together in a section dirtier than the one
in which he sat. It was growing warm. In another few
weeks summer would be there.</p>

<p>Pinkney was just leaving the telegraph office.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I was going to see you today,” said Robert
with a guilty feeling.</p>

<p>“So you got our summons from the Fourth Dimension?”
inquired Pinkney with an earnest smile. “We need
brave men, real men, Hamilton, to carry on our work.”
There was an allusion to the flaming rood that Robert did
not understand and he was able to get away only long
enough to send a short message to McCall. Pinkney took
his arm and insisted on escorting him to his office. On
the way they paused to exchange a few words with
acquaintances, some of whom referred mysteriously to the
coming concilium.</p>

<p>Pinkney’s office was a truly magnificent one, just off the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
main office of the Corinth Lumber Company, with a commanding
sweep of the city’s principal thoroughfare. One’s
feet sank into a soft, thick rug of mauve and one’s eye
immediately took in the glass-covered mahogany desk and
the decorations on the <span class="lock">wall—</span>a silk American flag under
glass, his captain’s commission in the home guards, a college
diploma, a membership in some civic organization and
a poem “To My Mother”—all framed. Not until they had
come quite into the room did they notice that they were
not alone. A rather tall, wavy-haired man with shrewd
blue eyes and a straight-line mouth was standing at the
window, chewing a cigar. He wore a light checked suit
and tan oxfords, and had the appearance of looking older
than he really was. As he saw Pinkney he waved his right
hand in an indefinite salute without, at the same time,
straightening up.</p>

<p>“Captain Hamilton,” said Pinkney, “this is Mr. Griffith.”</p>

<p>They shook hands, Robert mumbled an acknowledgment
and Mr. Griffith said he was very glad to meet him.</p>

<p>“Mr. <span class="lock">Griffith—</span>later you’ll know him by a rather more
pretentious title, <span class="lock">Robert—</span>is what I might term the brains
of the Tribe,” remarked Pinkney. “Won’t you gentlemen
take a seat? Now we can talk more comfortably. Cigars?
Oh, try a <em>good</em> brand.”</p>

<p>Griffith smiled so that all his teeth, including a gold tooth
in front and several gold-filled ones, shone.</p>

<p>“That’s just some o’ his bull. Don’t you pay any attention
to him,” he laughed.</p>

<p>“No, that’s the whole truth. You know, Captain, while
you were fighting for civilization on Flanders Fields,
Griffith was one of the men who was fighting the good fight
over here through the most potent weapon that man has
ever devised.” Griffith grinned as though Pinkney were
quoting a phrase with which he was familiar, or, perhaps,
had even coined himself. “That weapon is nothing else
than publicity!”</p>

<p>Hamilton nodded. Since his return he had learned that
cotton, that wood, that conservation of coal and food, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
the county councils of defense, that the women, that the
Y. M. C. A., that a hundred different things had won the
war, and he was not surprised to hear now that publicity
was the most potent weapon of mankind.</p>

<p>“Griffith here is an old newspaper man.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I know a newspaper man,” said Hamilton, to make
talk. “One of my best friends in the army was correspondent
for the Chicago Times.”</p>

<p>“What’s his name?”</p>

<p>“McCall.”</p>

<p>“Sure. I’ve read his stuff. So he was over with your
outfit. Gee, he could have cleaned up if he’d been
home.”</p>

<p>Pinkney resumed charge of the conversation and employed
it in briefly sketching the more recent portion of
Griffith’s biography. He had been connected with some
newspaper when the war broke out, what connection, was
evidently unimportant, Pinkney casting all newspaper men
in one huge category as he might walnut logs or hardwood.
At the outbreak of the World War he had foreseen the
tremendous importance of publicity and had offered his
services to various organizations in raising funds, recruiting
members, and so forth. He had been secretary of the
first drive ever held in Corinth to raise money for the
Belgian war sufferers. Later when the Red Cross, the
Y. M. C. A., the Y. W. C. A., the Salvation Army, the
Near East, the Chinese, the French and several local and
state organizations had started their drives Griffith’s services
had been in demand.</p>

<p>“Corinth went over the top on every drive through this
man,” said Pinkney proudly.</p>

<p>The expression “over the top” grated on Hamilton. It
was the same phrase McCall had used in describing his
coming operation.</p>

<p>“Weren’t you the first man to use ‘over the top’ to
describe exceeding a quota?” asked Pinkney.</p>

<p>“Some say I was,” smiled Griffith. “But I’ve got to be
going, folks. I’m mapping out a campaign to cover the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
entire United States.” He leaned over the desk, and drew
diagrams on it with his finger as he spoke. There were
hard, practical lines about his mouth, and his eyes narrowed
almost to slits. “See, we’ll cover every section.
We’ll have a perfect military organization with a commander-in-chief
at the head.”</p>

<p>He went on, sketching rapidly with his forefinger on
the mahogany his idea of a feudalistic system that would
make the Tribe all powerful in the United States. There
were strategic positions to be carried at all <span class="lock">costs—</span>certain
localities in each state which offered an easy entrance.
There were districts, corresponding to congressional districts,
that must be covered by an army of Bogeys. Here
was a citadel hard to break through. Here a breach in
the walls. He waxed more and more enthusiastic over his
plan. His words came more and more forcibly. His forefinger
flashed faster and faster. His eyes gleamed. He
leaned over the desk and pounded on it with his fist.</p>

<p>A transformed figure, Hamilton thought, from the man
who had slouched against the wall when he had first <span class="lock">entered—</span>an
almost fanatical leader, carried away with an idea.
The plan was made up of bits of military science, of salesmanship,
perhaps picked up through some correspondence
course, of the technique of carrying on drives. Out of his
miscellaneous reading, evidently, and out of an idea upon
which he had been brooding perhaps for years, this man
had evolved his huge “campaign.” Hamilton guessed that
he was a few years above the draft age and reflected ironically
what might have happened if Griffith, with his almost
insane imagination, had been placed in charge of a body
of troops in France.</p>

<p>“And we’re going to have you with us, Captain Hamilton,”
exclaimed Griffith at last, shaking hands and making
for the door. “Got a blank? All right, let him fill it out.
The concilium meets Tuesday night. Only a few more
days and we can get him in on this. Well, I’m glad I
met you, Captain.”</p>

<p>Griffith put on his soft felt hat a little to one side and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
walked out. Hamilton made a movement as if to follow,
too.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute, Robert, fill this out!”</p>

<p>Pinkney removed a card from his drawer and handed it
to Robert.</p>

<p>“What we need is men who have been overseas, preferably
officers, in order to get the soldiers interested in it.”</p>

<p>Robert looked at the row of questions on the card.
Was his motive in answering serious? His age, occupation,
birthplace, length of local residence and so forth.</p>

<p>“This is worse than an income tax questionnaire,”
laughed Robert. “They want to know the color of my
hair and eyes, where my parents were born, and my religion.
Well, that’s easy enough. But what’s the idea of
asking my politics?”</p>

<p>Pinkney smiled. “Oh, some of the questions, I suppose,
aren’t really necessary. But we wish to be absolutely
exclusive. Suppose a man should answer that he was a
Socialist or an Anarchist?”</p>

<p>“Why in the devil would an Anarchist want to join the
Trick Track Tribe? He’s opposed to all government.
Why should he pay dues to belong to a sort of feudal
government, according to the way Griffith outlined it?”</p>

<p>“Well, he <span class="lock">might—</span>I suppose he really wouldn’t, but that
really isn’t it. Oh, you’ll find out after you join.”</p>

<p>Robert had been asked to join other secret organizations.
In every case there had been a certain air of mystery about
it and a great to do about selecting only persons of a high
level for membership, and, although he had joined only the
exclusive Corinth Club, he had always suspected that the
mysteriousness and air of exclusiveness of the others had
been maintained principally with a view to making membership
seem more difficult and hence more desirable. A
few questions struck his attention, however, as he jotted
down his answers:</p>

<p>“Were your parents born in the United States of
America?</p>

<p>“Are you a Gentile or a Jew?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span></p>

<p>“Do you believe in the principles of Pure Americanism?</p>

<p>“Do you believe in white supremacy?</p>

<p>“What is your religious faith?</p>

<p>“Of what church are you a member, if any?</p>

<p>“Of what religious faith are your parents?</p>

<p>“Do you owe any kind of allegiance to any foreign nation,
government, institution, sect, people, ruler or person?”</p>

<p>Robert finished answering the questions and signed a
statement “asserting and affirming” that the questions had
been truthfully answered.</p>

<p>“Well,” he rose, “I don’t know whether I’ve answered
all your questions satisfactorily or not—”</p>

<p>“We’ll let you know,” Pinkney waved the card dry and
extended his hand. “But don’t worry about that. The
initiation will be next Tuesday. We’ll tell you exactly
where to be. Don’t forget!”</p>

<p>Robert walked out of the office with Pinkney’s injunction
ringing in his ear. After all, the insistence of every
one to have him join the Tribe was rather flattering. But
the rest of the day his mind was not so much on the coming
ceremony as on the outcome of McCall’s operation.</p>

</div>

<p>Robert did not ask Margaret to set the day for their
marriage that day. It was no time for him to be planning
his nuptials while his buddy was risking his life in the hospital.
He told Margaret of the operation and she sympathized
with him.</p>

<p>“What a dreadful thing the war is,” she said. “I don’t
suppose you’d care to go anywhere under the circumstances.
I can just understand the way you feel. We
might just sit at home tonight if you wish and I’ll sing
you some ballads.”</p>

<p>She confided her own troubles to him. Difficulty in getting
the proper clothing in Corinth. Difficulty in getting
her parents to appreciate her more liberal views. Difficulty
in getting her mother to allow her to discard corsets. What
had happened to the comparatively demure miss that Robert
had left behind when he had left Corinth? Two years
ago she would no more have dreamed of mentioning corsets
than she would have dreamed of smoking a pipe. As
for not wearing them, Robert remembered, with amusement,
that whereas preachers in describing Corinth as a second
Babylon two years ago had pointed to the fact that
women were pinching in their waists and allowing their
skirts to drag on the ground for the sake of increasing
their fascination in the eyes of men, they were now decrying
the shameless Jezebels who went with skirts but to their
knees and without certain garments that women had always
worn. Times had changed.</p>

<p>“I’m thinking of bobbing my hair,” said Margaret. She
was curled up on the couch beside him in a childish posture
which she would have thought unladylike before the war.
“Irene Castle has bobbed hers. But mother has a fit whenever
I mention the subject. She won’t even let me smoke.
What do you think about it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I suppose I’m a little old-fashioned—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span></p>

<p>“All the men are like that. Howard says the same thing.
Dad says it’s immoral. For heaven’s sakes, what’s the way
you’ve got your hair combed got to do with morality? Or
whether you smoke or not? Men can do everything and
the minute a woman wants to do something they do, every
one sits on her.”</p>

<p>Robert laughed.</p>

<p>“You look exactly like a small child protesting because
you can’t have another piece of candy.”</p>

<p>Margaret pretended to cry in vexation.</p>

<p>“That’s the trouble with you men, you refuse to take us
seriously.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you were old and ugly, I suppose I could sit
down and argue the thing out with you. But in that case,
of course, I wouldn’t care if you clipped your hair or
chewed tobacco. Taking you as you are, however, and as
I expect you to be to me, I prefer you with your hair
exactly as it <span class="lock">is—</span>even if it is hard to <span class="lock">comb—</span>and without
any cigarette between your ruby lips. Of course, in France
I saw many splendid women with bobbed hair, and of
course, every one smokes there. But that was <span class="lock">Paris—</span>and
I don’t think you’d look well with a cigarette.”</p>

<p>“That’s no reason at all.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it isn’t. Still, why shouldn’t it be? Suppose
you didn’t look as well with bobbed hair or smoking a
cigarette. Shouldn’t that be reason enough?”</p>

<p>“But supposing <em>I</em> thought I looked just as well? If we
were married would you forbid me to bob my hair?”</p>

<p>Hamilton considered.</p>

<p>“Not that it would do any good, perhaps, but I think I
would.”</p>

<p>Margaret sat up very suddenly.</p>

<p>“There,” she wrenched the ring from her finger, “if you
expect to control me after we’re married, we might as well
call it off now before it’s too late.”</p>

<p>Robert turned white and his hand trembled as it went
out. He stammered unintelligibly.</p>

<p>“Wh-<span class="lock">why—</span>why?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span></p>

<p>Margaret suddenly laughed.</p>

<p>“I ought to have a snapshot of you. You really thought
I meant it. You put your hand out to take it. There, now
you may have the pleasure of putting it back again.”</p>

<p>She moved closer to him and placed her right arm about
him as he replaced the ring.</p>

<p>“My, you look solemn. You look as though you were
actually sorry that I didn’t give you the ring back.”</p>

<p>“No, but you did shock me. Why did you do it, dear?”
As he said this he was dimly aware of the fact that there
was a trace of truth in what she had said. A very faint
trace. He drew her to him and patted her dark hair slowly.</p>

<p>“Well, that is what I wanted,” she blushed. “You’ve
acted so cool lately. You haven’t kissed me once this
evening.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I did.”</p>

<p>“I mean since you came in. You seem always thinking
about something else. So I gave you this shock to, to—”</p>

<p>He kissed her warmly on the lips. He noticed her eyes
close and her head tilt back and against him. He heard her
sigh and wondered that he could so coolly watch her the
while. Poor child, she expected his love. He drew her
still more closely to him.</p>

<p>“You haven’t said a word <span class="lock">about—</span>about our wedding.”</p>

<p>Robert flushed.</p>

<p>“No, darling. I haven’t talked over business matters with
father yet. He seems so busy lately. But as soon as I do
we’ll talk it over.”</p>

<p>Love is a peculiar thing, Hamilton thought on the way
home. He felt sorry for Margaret. He sympathized with
her. Still he had no desire to fondle her. He had done so
simply because he knew that she desired it. Was this love?
Or was it something else?</p>

<p>Perhaps it was the highest form of <span class="lock">love—</span>the love springing
from sympathy. And still he had postponed making the
decision as to the date of their marriage. Well, by right he
should talk to his father first about the business. Here a
whole month had gone by during which he had simply<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
loafed about the house and attended innumerable society
affairs.</p>

<p>He decided that he must return the poem to McCall, or
rather to Dorothy, with a little note explaining how he had
found it. Margaret’s actions had given him a new insight
into such things. He appreciated better how Dorothy would
miss it. He could enclose the poem and the note in another
letter to Levin, whose address he had. Levin would surely
know where to reach her. Perhaps it would be better to
wait until tomorrow, until after the operation. In any case
Dorothy would be glad to get the poem back again, but he
would know better tomorrow how to word the letter to her.</p>

<p>Robert was inspecting the rose bushes with his mother
late the next day when Mammy Chloe appeared at the door.</p>

<p>“The telegram company want Mistah Cap’n Robe’t Hamilton
at de phone.”</p>

<p>“All right, just a minute.”</p>

<p>“Dat’s what I tell ’em.”</p>

<p>Hamilton was very white, a nervous smile about the corners
of his mouth. Mrs. Hamilton gave his arm a little pat:</p>

<p>“Everything will be all right.”</p>

<p>Robert was conscious of her watching him as he hurried
up the walk and into the doorway. He could see the patterns
of the stone blocks and the lines made by the moss.
The branch of an oak tree hung over him and he heard
birds chirping in the rustling foliage. Life seemed to pause,
to hang between the ticking of a watch. He heard insects
humming.</p>

<p>The operator was reading the message, mechanically, by
syllables, so that they barely made sense. But he understood.
The operation had been successful! He ran out of
the house excitedly, waving his arms and sputtering. His
mother understood. They both talked excitedly for a moment
without listening to each other.</p>

<p>“I knew it would be all right. I knew it would be all
right,” Mrs. Hamilton was repeating over and over again.</p>

<p>“Let’s have some one over here tonight,” said Robert excitedly.
“Didn’t we use to know some one named McCall?”</p>

<p>“McCall?”</p>

<p>“Or something like that? I must call up Margaret.”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean the McFallons?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I haven’t seen them since I came back. Don’t they
come here any more?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Hamilton looked down.</p>

<p>“No, Robert,” she said quietly.</p>

<p>“But I thought you used to be such good friends.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span></p>

<p>He ran into the house to telephone Margaret. He had
an impulse to run about the city spreading the news, when
he recalled that no one knew who McCall was or had the
least interest in him.</p>

<p>“I’m going to have some fellows over tonight,” he sang
out to his mother. “Is it all right?”</p>

<p>“I’ll be only too glad.”</p>

<p>“I think I’ll call up Jack Perry. He’s back now and Tom
McBride, I haven’t seen them in an age. And, of course,
Howard Pinkney isn’t such a bad scout.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Howard is a fine chap.”</p>

<p>“<span class="lock">You—</span>you haven’t anything against the others have <span class="lock">you—</span>Jack
and Tom?” Hamilton had perceived something in
her praise of Howard that might have been interpreted as a
criticism of them.</p>

<p>“No, not against them.” Mrs. Hamilton was silent for
a moment. She stooped down to pluck off a dry leaf, then
rose and brushed back a wisp of loose hair. “But I thought
you were going to join the Tribe.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Tuesday night.”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t you know that they’re Catholics?”</p>

<p>“Who, the Perrys and the McBrides?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t thought about it at all, but what if they are?
McCall is a Catholic, too.”</p>

<p>“Well, you know, dear, that Catholics can’t belong to the
Trick Track Tribe.”</p>

<p>“Well, what of it? I can’t belong to the Knights of Columbus.
But I think Mr. Perry and Jack both belong. Yes,
I remember they do. That never kept them from inviting
us. No, that’s impossible. Why some of our most prominent
men here are Catholics. Half, say a third anyway, of
the Corinth Club are Catholics. What’s belonging to a
lodge got to do with it anyway?”</p>

<p>“Well, you may call them, dear, if you wish. Certainly
I have no objections. Personally I should be glad to have
both Mrs. Perry and Mrs. McBride over. <span class="lock">But—</span>well, you
call them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span></p>

<p>Hamilton frowned. As he kept growing older he kept
bumping into stronger and more surprising prejudices. At
three he had learned of the existence of that line between
the whites and the blacks. At seven he learned the sharp
distinction between the rich and the poor. Next it had been
Jew and Gentile. For a few years he had almost forgotten
about these social barriers. Now came the most surprising
one of all, the most difficult to understand.</p>

<p>Jack Perry and Tom McBride were both at <span class="lock">home—</span>it was
nearly <span class="lock">six—</span>and expressed their delight at the invitation.
The Perrys were out of the city, but Tom would ask his
parents to come.</p>

<p>“I told you they’d come,” said Robert to his mother. “It’s
almost time for dinner. They’re coming a little after
eight.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Hamilton looked surprised.</p>

<p>“I don’t know where you could have gotten such an idea,
mother. Why, how is it possible?” He tried to tell her
what was in his mind. The war. The country united to
win. The allied soldiers of many different nations and races
and religions. And the armistice only signed a few months
ago. But, of course, she knew all that.</p>

<p>Mr. Hamilton had been called out of town on business
and they ate alone. There was joy in Robert’s heart.
McCall would be able to see. He must write him immediately
and send Dorothy the poem. The telephone bell ringing,
broke into his thoughts. It was Tom. His parents had
made another engagement for the evening of which he had
known nothing and like a dutiful son he would be obliged
to accompany them. Tomorrow night he would also be
engaged. But he’d see him some other time. Robert was
turning away when the bell rang again. It was Jack Perry.
He had phoned before but the line was busy. He had suddenly
remembered that he had an engagement with someone.
With whom? Why, with Tom McBride.</p>

<p>“Why, what’s the matter with you, Jack?” asked Robert.</p>

<p>“Nothing,” said Jack. “I simply forgot for the moment.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
By the way, I understand that you’ve joined the Trick
Track Tribe.”</p>

<p>“No, not yet.” Was Jack trying to pump him? He remembered
suddenly that joining the Tribe was supposed
to be a secret. Jack’s voice became hard over the phone,
hard and formally polite.</p>

<p>“Mr. McBride and I are going to attend the Knights of
Columbus, a little business meeting. Tell Pinkney and
Griffith and the Rev. Mr. Lister that. A Knights of Columbus
meeting. Goodbye.”</p>

<p>“But listen, old man—”</p>

<p>It was too late. Perry had rung off. He returned to the
table crestfallen and repeated his conversation to his mother.</p>

<p>“The Knights of Columbus!” she said. “You see they
were right!”</p>

<p>“Who were right?”</p>

<p>“Howard and Mr. Griffith. They were over here almost
six months ago, just before dad joined the Tribe. They
were arguing about the power of the Knights of Columbus.
It was hard to believe all they said, but they brought proofs
of their activities.”</p>

<p>“What activities? I don’t believe it. Why, at camp, I
used to be in the K. C. hut as much as the Y. M. C. A.
And now they’re starting schools for the ex-service men.”</p>

<p>“It’s an organization to control politics in the United
States for the benefit of the Catholic church.”</p>

<p>Robert laughed.</p>

<p>“Mother, do you really believe that? Who’s the governor
of our state? He’s a Protestant. Who’s the mayor of our
city? Another Protestant. Who are our aldermen? Mostly
<span class="lock">Protestants—</span>a few Catholics.”</p>

<p>“Ask Dad about the Catholic problem when he comes
back, or Howard,” suggested Mrs. Hamilton. “Really,
Robert, I don’t know much about it, except from what I’ve
heard at the discussions. Of course, there are secrets that
dad cannot tell me. But I know that since he joined the
Tribe we haven’t associated with any Catholics. Some very
fine people, too. Some of my best friends.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span></p>

<p>She sighed and looked thoughtfully down at the tablecloth.</p>

<p>“Dad wouldn’t go over to the Perrys after he joined and
he always managed to stay away when they came here. I
have nothing against them. But you know how it is.”</p>

<p>“Is it that way all over Corinth?” asked Robert. “I
haven’t noticed. Yes, I have. There haven’t been any
Catholics at most of the functions. And there did seem
to be some dissention at the club. There’s no sense to it.
It’s got to stop. Why should a fellow risk his life in
Europe fighting for democracy and come home to find his
own town torn up by the most undemocratic barriers in
the <span class="lock">world—</span>religion.</p>

<p>“We’re forming an <span class="lock">organization—</span>that is the veterans of
the <span class="lock">war—</span>a democratic organization where every one is
on the same footing as every one else. Even rank means
nothing there. The private has the same rights and privileges
as the general. Race, social position, <span class="lock">religion—</span>all
these distinctions have been swept away. The American
Legion is for all who have been in the service. Why, it
doesn’t even matter whether they enlisted or were drafted!
That’s real Americanism. But Pinkney keeps talking about
the Tribe’s campaign for Americanism. There must be
some mistake somewhere. If the Knights of Columbus are
going into politics and stirring up religious prejudice, it’s
got to stop. I don’t know exactly what Pinkney means by
white supremacy, aside from the supremacy it naturally has,
and I don’t see the necessity of a society standing for pure
<span class="lock">womanhood—</span>why that’s part of every man’s religion, of
every social and moral law in the world!—but I do know
what Americanism means. I can see that it’s needed here
and I’m going into the Tribe because I believe a powerful
organization like that can help spread it!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XXIV"><abbr title="Twenty-four">XXIV</abbr></h2>
</div>

<p>Late Tuesday night Robert was picked up at a street
corner which had been designated, by an automobile filled
with white-robed and hooded figures. The Tribesman beside
him placed his finger on his lips and the journey was
made in silence. It was a fantastic ride, through the dimly
lighted streets, then through the shadowy suburbs, into the
country. There was a full moon and under it the earth
looked a grotesque thing of <span class="lock">shadows—</span>a phantasy in black
and white.</p>

<p>As they left the city, Robert noticed other cars, with
similar loads of hooded figures, ahead and behind them, all
moving silently and without lights. Within a half hour they
had reached a large field, the fences guarding which had
been pulled down, and in the center of which a circle of
cars was being parked under the silent direction of Tribesmen.</p>

<p>Robert and the members of his party dismounted and
crossed the field to a thickly-wooded glade, at the edge of
which a narrow path was faintly visible in the moonlight.
Other candidates joined him until there were perhaps one
hundred. These were formed into a long column by means
of whispers and gestures. It was exactly midnight by Robert’s
wrist watch when suddenly a tall figure in white, bearing
aloft a fiery cross, appeared. He marched to the head
of the column, the light of the rood casting a ruddy reflection
on the upturned faces of the initiates and on the figures
in white and causing the shadows to dance back and forth
grotesquely. As the bearer of the fiery cross moved slowly
forward, the neophytes in groups of ten, each conducted by
a Tribesman, followed along the path in the grove, which
now gleamed and faded before their footsteps.</p>

<p>It was an awe-inspiring sight. Hamilton was carried
back to his childhood, to his first fear of shadows and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
spectres. Weird ghost stories flickered through his mind.
He remembered strange rites of primitive <span class="lock">peoples—</span>the
initiation of headhunters into their bloody mysteries, of the
fearful Thugs, of the secret societies of the Bantus. The
shadows clutched about him and the blaze of light flamed
up and down ahead.</p>

<p>He had proceeded perhaps fifty feet, when he was suddenly
aware of a hooded figure standing motionless beside
the path, a grim sentinel, peering at him through the slits
in his mask. Fifty feet farther, at a bend in the path,
stood another sentinel. They had passed six of these silent
figures in white, when the winding column was brought
to a sudden halt. The bearer of the cross was being questioned
by a guardian. His voice rang through the grove:</p>

<p>“What if any of your party should prove a traitor?”</p>

<p>The reply came in a deep, solemn voice to the hushed
initiates:</p>

<p>“He would be immediately banished in disgrace from
the Fourth Dimension without fear or favor, conscience
would tenaciously torment him, remorse repeatedly revile
him, and direful things would befall him.”</p>

<p>Again the questioner:</p>

<p>“Does he know this?”</p>

<p>And again the rejoinder:</p>

<p>“All this he knows. He has heard and he must heed.”</p>

<p>A countersign was given, the guard stepped back, and
the column moved forward. Hamilton found himself in
a clearing, from the center of which rose a rude altar and
about which hundreds of hooded Tribesmen stood massed.
The bearer of the fiery cross circled the clearing. The
groups of neophytes followed.</p>

<p>The white forms, the flickering light, all had confused
Hamilton and he now perceived that the Tribesmen were
standing in a double rank, through which he was marching.
Four times the group stopped before a Tribesman, who sat
exalted on a high chair or <span class="lock">rock—</span>exactly what, it was
too dark to <span class="lock">see—</span>and harangued them. There were questions
about obedience, about secrecy, about fidelity, about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
tribal fealty. Robert was too confused to hear all the
questions or to understand those he heard.</p>

<p>The groups of neophytes had once more become a line.
The bearer of the fiery rood stalked behind the altar and
thrust the flaming emblem in the ground. It was the sole
light. A masked figure stepped forward and held out his
hand:</p>

<p>“Always remember that to keep the oath means to you,
honor, happiness and life; but to violate it means disgrace,
dishonor and <em>death</em>.” It was a voice of frenzy. The flames
and shadows danced weirdly. The moon gleamed through
the black trees. The silent Tribesmen peered through the
slits in their hoods.</p>

<p>“You will place your left hand over your heart and raise
your right hand to heaven.”</p>

<p>Robert obeyed and, in chorus with the other initiates,
repeated the words of the oath:</p>

<p>“I, in the presence of God and man, most solemnly
pledge, promise and swear”—and so forth to the end. It
was an oath of obedience to the sublime authority of the
Tribe and to the head of the Tribe, Joseph Andrew Lister.</p>

<p>Then the oath of secrecy, in which the candidates swore
that they would rather die than divulge any of the secrets.</p>

<p>Next an oath to work for the good of the Tribe in spite
of personal or other conflicting motives.</p>

<p>Last of all an oath of fealty to the Tribe, of protection
of members.</p>

<p>“I swear that I will keep secure to myself a secret of
a Tribesman when same is committed to me in the sacred
bond of Tribal <span class="lock">fealty—</span>the crime of violating THIS solemn
oath, treason against the United States of America, rape
and malicious murder alone excepted.” Malicious murder?
What could that mean? Why the qualification of murder?
For a fleeting moment Robert was puzzled. But he went
on mechanically with the oath.</p>

<p>“I most solemnly assert and affirm that to the government
of the United States of America and any state thereof
of which I may become a resident I sacredly swear an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
unqualified allegiance above any other and every kind of
government in the whole world. I here and now pledge
my life, my property, my vote and my sacred honor to
uphold its flag, its Constitution and its constitutional laws
and will protect, defend and enforce same unto death.</p>

<p>“I swear that I will most zealously and valiantly shield
and preserve by any and all justifiable means and methods
(justifiable? Again a question came into Robert’s mind.
But he dismissed it.) the sacred constitutional rights and
privileges of free public schools, free speech, free press,
separation of church and state, liberty, white supremacy,
just laws and the pursuit of happiness against any encroachment
of any nature by any person, persons, political party
or parties, religious sect or people, native, naturalized or
foreign, of any race, color, creed, lineage or tongue whatsoever.”</p>

<p>The head of the Tribe, himself, who had previously
impressed on the candidates the sacredness of the oath now
took from the altar a water bottle. Robert noticed, for the
first time, that, beside the bottle, the altar held also an
American flag, a Bible and a dagger.</p>

<p>“With this transparent, life-giving, powerful, God-given
fluid,” he began, his voice rising and falling in even
cadences, “more precious and far more significant than all
the sacred oils of the ancients, I set you apart from the
men of your daily association to the great and honorable
task you have voluntarily allotted yourselves as citizens of
the Fourth Dimension, Hunters of the Trick Track Tribe.
You will kneel upon your right knee.”</p>

<p>Robert felt as though he were in the midst of some weird
nightmare. He had had that impression all evening. Now
it seemed <span class="lock">deepened—</span>the figures in white, the darkness, the
eerie moon, the gleaming cross, the shadows. But what was
happening now, or about to happen, seemed too utterly
unreal. It was like one of those points in a dream where
the dreamer cries out “I am only dreaming,” and strives
desperately to awake. It could not be possible! Still the
Tribal Head held the water bottle. Was he about to perform<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
a baptismal rite? Robert had no particularly delicate
religious scruples. Still, the burlesquing of the sacrament
of baptism shocked his sensibilities. He would have been
equally shocked if someone had trampled on the American
<span class="lock">flag—</span>if someone had cruelly trampled on the flag of any
other nation. It was fanatical. Robert was conscious of
a quartette, somewhere far away, singing a hymn in low,
yet distinct tones. Something about “Home, country and
tribe.” He noticed that he was kneeling with the hundred
other candidates.</p>

<p>The voice of the Tribal Head rose:</p>

<p>“I dedicate you in body, in mind, in spirit and in life to
the holy service of our country and our tribe, our home,
each other and humanity.”</p>

<p>He advanced and poured a few drops of water on each
candidate’s neck.</p>

<p>“In body,” Hamilton heard him say as a drop fell on his
back; “in mind,” a few drops fell on his head; “in spirit,”
the officer sprinkled a few drops on his own hand and tossed
them upward; “in life.” He moved his hand in a circle
above the candidates’ heads. The baptism was ended. Officers
and Tribesmen fell on their knees and prayed.</p>

<p>The fiery cross flickered above them. The black shadows
danced faster. A cloud obscured the moon. Robert was
a Tribesman.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">


<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XXV"><abbr title="Twenty-five">XXV</abbr></h2>
</div>

<p>It was the day after his initiation into the Tribe. Robert
had slept late, the strange ceremony having run incessantly
through his mind in a series of shadowy dreams. Words
of the oaths had repeated themselves, the Tribal hymn, the
threat of death to the disloyal: “Remember that to keep
this oath means honor, happiness, and life; but to violate it
means disgrace, dishonor and death. (Then, ironically)—May
honor, happiness and life be yours.”</p>

<p>The ceremony had been impressive. It had impressed
with an idea of primal <span class="lock">power—</span>the power of men, freed
from all shackles, and united by a pure, strong, simple
faith. Christianity. Racial purity. Patriotism. Womanhood.
Ideals which it was well to raise up, to fight for if
necessary. And Americanism. Through such an organization
of men of common birth, religion and ideals, everything
could be accomplished. Yes, he was proud of being
a Tribesman!</p>

<p>Last night the baptism ritual had shocked him, but now
the towering seriousness of the Tribe justified it. Exactly
how the Tribe meant to function Robert did not know.
Doubtless it would be explained to him later. He was eager
to know. Griffith had given some hint at Pinkney’s office.
He wished to know and to serve. Someone had said something
about the Knights of Columbus trying to control politics.
But that had been his mother. Yet she had overheard
others, Tribesmen, talking about it. Could that be true?
Could so un-American a thing be crushed by the Tribe?</p>

<p>Robert found Mr. Hamilton walking up and down the
porch, chewing the end of his cigar.</p>

<p>“That was a tremendous thing, governor,” said Robert,
“I think the most tremendous thing in my life.</p>

<p>“I shall never forget it as long as I live. And I want to
take an active interest in it. Now—”</p>

<p>He hesitated. Mr. Hamilton cleared his throat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span></p>

<p>“Now,” Robert continued. “I’m ready to start in again.
My wound is practically well, I’ve had a good rest and I
mean to pitch in wherever I’m wanted.”</p>

<p>“I wanted you to have a good rest, Bob, before I told
you. Let’s sit down over here on the bench. We’ve seen
this moment coming a long <span class="lock">time—</span>mother and <span class="lock">I—</span>and we’ve
shrunk from it. I suppose you’ve noticed a change here?”</p>

<p>Robert had. Little changes. Only Mammy Chloe and
George were left of the five servants. Only one car. Only
one horse. Little things like that. And then, he suddenly
remembered, the office had been closed in New York.</p>

<p>“Oh, I thought,” he was going to say that they were
economizing, “I don’t know what I thought. I guess I
didn’t think about it at all.”</p>

<p>“Well, the war has made some men, but it’s broken me.
Not completely, but—” he waved his cigar. “There’s
enough for us to live on the rest of our <span class="lock">lives—</span>that is the
three of <span class="lock">us—</span>although on a slightly reduced scale. Oh,
there’s nothing to worry about. Only, only, it isn’t what I
had planned for you.” His voice broke and he pretended
to relight his cigar.</p>

<p>They had often talked over their plans. Robert was to
learn the more important aspects of the business, eventually
succeed his father as president, leaving the details, however,
to a competent staff. His income would enable him to live
according to his own ideas of <span class="lock">life—</span>to ride, to hunt, to fish,
to play tennis, to acquire the easy culture that comes with
leisure, to surround himself with a society of men and
women of similar tastes and to patronize, perhaps even
essay, the arts. The older Hamilton had been able, in a
measure, to live in accordance with these ideas.</p>

<p>Now perhaps they would have to take an apartment and
cut down their expenditures. There would be an income
ample for all <span class="lock">necessities—</span>even for the best apartment in
Corinth, for a reasonable amount of entertaining.</p>

<p>“But can’t anything be done? Can’t I pitch in—?”</p>

<p>Mr. Hamilton laughed and looked at his son kindly.</p>

<p>“You’ve used that expression twice today, Bob,” he said.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
“It’s not like pitching hay or even pitching for a baseball
team. I know you’re willing. But the smashup came while
you were still in <span class="lock">France—</span>right after the armistice. It’s
not as though anyone can help at this stage of the game,
like a pinch hitter.”</p>

<p>Robert wondered how his father could take the matter
so lightly. He suddenly gripped his father’s hand and
stammered:</p>

<p>“It’s great how you can smile through everything like
that. It’s—!”</p>

<p>Mr. Hamilton patted his shoulder.</p>

<p>“Wait until you’re my age, son. My loss is really nothing.
There are things tremendously more important than
money. Health, love, friendship. The ability to appreciate
this cigar or to tell a good drink or a good book from a
poor one. Money is valuable only in buying that appreciation.
I’ve tried to give you <span class="lock">that—</span>to give you an education
and a viewpoint. And we still have enough money left to
buy a few good cigars and drinks and books.”</p>

<p>Mr. Hamilton sketched the decline of the Hamilton corporation.
It had never been as important as Robert had
<span class="lock">thought—</span>there had always been heavily mortgaged properties,
for instance. During the war, most of the hardwood
lands had been sold and the money used to expand the
cotton mills. In the spring of 1918 it seemed certain that
the war would last at least another year and so a huge plant
had been erected near Charleston. Prices were high, the
work lagged, the expense was enormous. In order to insure
a sufficient supply of cotton and to guard against continued
increases in price, Hamilton had bought heavily for
future delivery. The armistice had come. The bottom had
fallen out of the market. The demand for cotton goods
had ceased. There was no foreign market. Well, it was
hopeless. Out of the mess there would be left perhaps
$200,000, anyway $100,000. He had disposed of most of
his stock at a small figure. A set of Yankees and Jews
were in control.</p>

<p>“Whatever you do,” said Mr. Hamilton, looking at Robert<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
steadily, “whatever you do, don’t gamble on the exchange.
Poker is all right, within your means. It’s a
gentleman’s game. Dice has an honorable origin and at
least you get a chance to hold the dice once in a while. But
on the stock market or exchange you never hold the dice.
You’ll remember, won’t you?</p>

<p>“Now, I suppose this may interfere with your plans about
getting married. You are still young. I was thirty myself
when I married mother. The world is still before you.
There’s no hurry. Some day I know you will want to
choose your road. If you care to take up a profession,
there’s plenty to send you through. If you’re interested
in business, I may still have some influence and, perhaps,
a little cash, although all I have is tied up. As for myself,
I’m too old to go into a new business now. I was nearly
forty when you were born.”</p>

<p>“Of course I’ll want to do something now,” said Robert.</p>

<p>“You might talk it over with Pinkney. He’s a factor in
Corinth today. He’s talked to me about you several times.”</p>

<p>“He seems to be interested in the Tribe mainly.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Robert, there are many influential Corinthians interested
in the Tribe. It’s their hobby. <span class="lock">I—</span>I don’t know.
I joined, of course. I think its objects are splendid, commendable,
in fact. But after you’ve seen ten or twelve
initiations the glamor wears off. Perhaps I shouldn’t talk
to you like this. But you’re my son and you’ll understand.
The ceremonial is not for us. It’s to impress others. And
I’m a bit of a skeptic about any organization of human
beings. Perhaps this may work the miracle. I hope it can.
If you can prove useful in propagating its message, so
much the better. Patriotism. Regard for laws. Chivalry.
White supremacy. They’re all fine ideals.”</p>

<p>“Yes, they are, governor.”</p>

<p>“If you can prove valuable now to the Tribe, because
of your personality or war experience or whatever it is,
you will win the friendship of the most influential men in
Corinth. This work will simply be a stepping stone.
Pinkney’s a young man. He lacks certain qualities you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
have. He may not be all that you or I would seek in our
ideal man, but he has brains enough to appreciate you.
With the family name, the slight financial assistance I can
give you and the good will of the best element of Corinth,
the future is anything you care to make it. I don’t want
you to be merely a successful man, but success is not to be
despised and it may prove the open sesame to the life that
we planned.”</p>

<p>“Yes, governor, I understand.”</p>

<p>They stood up. Robert had never quite understood his
father before, it seemed. Smiling to the last. Well, he
could be like that too.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XXVI"><abbr title="Twenty-six">XXVI</abbr></h2>
</div>

<p>Robert found Pinkney, hat on head, about to leave the
office.</p>

<p>“Come along,” he said, “you’re just in time. I’m going
to the Tribe office. I’ll introduce you to the Sublime <span class="lock">Headman—</span>Joseph
Andrew Lister.” Together they descended
to the street.</p>

<p>“Lister? I heard the name at the concilium. Who is
he otherwise? Is he a Corinthian?”</p>

<p>“Lister?—have a cigar, Robert. He’s the Rev. Mr.
Lister, a very distinguished minister. Let me see. I think
he was a Methodist divine. But he has given up his clerical
work, he told me, to devote all his time to the Tribe. It
was his idea, in fact. He began recruiting members in about
1915 or so and laid the foundation. The office is only a
few blocks down.”</p>

<p>“I thought,” said Robert, “the initiation ceremony had a
sort of ecclesiastical flavor. It was very impressive though.
I dreamed about it all night.”</p>

<p>“Did you?” Pinkney grinned. “Lister and Griffith devised
it. Lister is the man with the ideal of solidifying the
best element in this country; while Griffith is the practical
man. He really made it. He works out all the plans. He
is really quite a capable fellow.”</p>

<p>They crossed the street, Pinkney, with his slightly annoying
habit of politeness, or excessive friendliness, holding
Hamilton’s arm and helping him. A persistent newsboy
thrust a paper before him and Pinkney bought two copies.</p>

<p>“Want one? I have mine delivered at the office every
day, but—”</p>

<p>Robert glanced at the streamer headline and discovered
the meaning of what the newsboy had been shouting. A
half-dozen masked men had taken a Negro from his place
of employment in Corinth, driven him far into the country
and tarred and feathered him. Members of the Trick Track<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
Tribe were suspected. Howard’s cheeks were flushed and
he moistened his lips with his tongue.</p>

<p>“Look at that,” said Robert, “they’re accusing the Tribe.”</p>

<p>“Oh, the police are friendly. The chief is one of us.
There’s no danger. Whenever something like this happens,
the Tribe is naturally blamed anyway. And if members of
the Tribe did do it, no one would tell. There’s been altogether
too much lawlessness among the niggers lately. The
courts are cluttered with them. It should be a good lesson
for them.”</p>

<p>“But isn’t this lawlessness?”</p>

<p>“The Tribe has its own law and metes out its own justice.
You’ll see. You’ve taken only your first degree. You
haven’t learned about the tribunal. It’s the fairest, justest
institution in the United States. It fortifies the ordinary
methods of law enforcement and insures justice to every
one whose case is brought before it. If a man is condemned
by it, be sure he is guilty.”</p>

<p>Robert noticed that Howard had not said that the Tribe
had or had not been responsible for the affair. Yet he had
vindicated it. There was a peculiar thing about the oath,
too, or one of them: a person was permitted to deny a fact
or even to falsify in defense of the Tribe. A phrase he had
heard somewhere popped into his mind: “A good dose of
tar taken externally with lots of feathers.”</p>

<p>Howard was detailing the offenses of the Negroes of
Corinth. Of the entire black race. Of the colored races.
What had they to do with this one individual human being
who had been punished by these superior white men? Well,
perhaps this man was guilty. The newspaper story hinted
that the victim had distributed among his fellow Negroes
white mule, a poisonous whiskey that incited the drinkers
to <span class="lock">violence—</span>when it did not paralyze them, more or less
permanently. After all, what was the law, but an institution
to maintain justice? It was an instrument of man. It
functioned through men. What difference was there fundamentally
if men in long white gowns and masks sentenced
you or a judge with a white wig and black robes or men in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
business suits! As long as the man was really guilty. And
ordinary justice often lagged, allowed the criminal to escape,
failed to impress its lesson on others.</p>

<p>“Oh, it was probably a good lesson at that,” said Robert.</p>

<p>“Probably!” exclaimed Pinkney. “Why there’s no doubt
about it. It will do more to restore law and order, to stop
the selling of white mule than raiding a dozen stills. I
know the niggers. You know them too, Hamilton. They’ll
become frightened and quit.”</p>

<p>The Rev. Mr. Lister was in his private office in conference
with Mr. Griffith and another gentleman, according to
the rather plump, middle-aged woman who sat typing in the
outer room. Pinkney introduced Robert to her. Her name
was Mrs. Ward. She had pleasant, a trifle flirtatious, brown
eyes, assisted Mr. Griffith in editing the Tribe paper and
various pamphlets, and chewed gum.</p>

<p>“Seen the last copy of the Clarion?” she asked, with a
smile, turning to reach for something.</p>

<p>“No, what’s that?” asked Robert.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ward and Pinkney informed him simultaneously
that it was a propaganda weekly, Mrs. Ward with a coquettish
shake of her finger and a somewhat more pronounced
appearance of her double chin.</p>

<p>“Captain Hamilton has just been initiated,” explained
Pinkney apologetically. “Mrs. Ward, here, is the brains of
the Tribe.”</p>

<p>She laughed.</p>

<p>“Here it is,” she said, handing the magazine to Robert.
“Aren’t men the flatterers? There’s a corker in this week
about the Catholics. You wanna read it. Didja see last
week’s Jew article, Mr. Pinkney? Griffith wrote ’em.
There’s some swell stuff about the Inquisition. I don’t see
where he reads so much.”</p>

<p>Hamilton glanced over the first page of The Clarion.
There was an engraving of de Torquemada with the caption,
“Do You Want Him Here?” beneath. But before
he could read beyond the first <span class="lock">paragraph—</span>a series of
queries, as to whether we wanted this or that medieval<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
institution <span class="lock">here—</span>he became conscious of voices raised in
the office of the Sublime Headman. First an impassioned,
angry voice. The words were indistinguishable. Then the
angry voice of the minister. Robert recognized the
cadences, rolling in anger:</p>

<p>“To violate your oath means disgrace, dishonor and
<em>death</em>.”</p>

<p>A door flew open. The voices ceased abruptly. A white-faced
man strode out of the room. He stopped in embarrassment
as he saw Pinkney, twisted his hat, screwed
his lips into a smile and mumbled a greeting, then stumbled
out of the room. Robert’s hands involuntarily crushed the
copy of The Clarion. A buzzer sounded.</p>

<p>“Come in, gentlemen,” called a sunny voice.</p>

<p>“Walk right in there,” beamed Mrs. Ward, adjusting a
new sheet in her typewriter. “He’s in there alone with
Griffith now.”</p>

<p>The Rev. Mr. Lister was seated at a mahogany <span class="lock">desk—</span>a
tall impressive figure in frock coat, wing collar and black
<span class="lock">cravat—</span>a dignified and picturesque survival of, say, the
middle of the nineteenth century, with a wavy mane parted
at one side and brushed back from a high forehead; thin
lips of the orator; intent pale blue eyes.</p>

<p>Joseph Andrew Lister had been an itinerant Methodist
preacher and later organizer for a fraternal society, before
the inspiration came to him to revive a secret society for the
reformation of humanity and the establishment of a more
perfect justice on earth. He had been born on a farm in
northern Georgia and had been obliged to rise at four
o’clock every morning to begin the day’s chores. He hated
farm life and, having at the age of seven, attended an Evangelistic
meeting, presided over by a fiery preacher, decided
to find solace in religion.</p>

<p>His parents, who were very religious, and an uncle, who
ran a small store in a neighboring town, scraped together
enough to send Joseph through a seminary, where he applied
himself with such zeal that he led all his classes. He knew
both testaments almost by heart and found in them the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
epitome of all wisdom. When not studying he was continually
composing sermons and delivering them, under his
breath in his room, or aloud in the fields or on the street.
At sixteen he come home on Sunday to preach at the church
where he had been confirmed and which his parents
attended, to their inexpressible pride.</p>

<p>He might have continued to serve as a minister, assisting
his parents with the less arduous duties of the farm between
sermons, had he not been induced to join a fraternal society
in his thirty-fifth year. He suddenly got an insight into a
new world. The idea of fraternal association and benevolence
in a lay organization fired his imagination and he saw
in it a greater field for spreading practical Christianity.
The position of organizer, besides, was somewhat more
remunerative, and so, when it was offered him, he abandoned
the pulpit. He was fairly successful in gaining new
members, won a reputation as a fiery talker and was looked
upon as a person of superior learning and godliness among
his associates. These qualities alone would not have sufficed
to build up the Trick Track Tribe had not the more
practical genius of Griffith pointed the way. Lister remained,
however, the figurehead and mouthpiece of the
organization which he had been unable to build, while
Griffith, the guiding genius, remained more or less in the
background.</p>

<p>“Good morning, brother Pinkney,” said the Rev. Mr.
Lister in orotund tones. “Isn’t this one of our initiates?
Ah, yes, Captain Hamilton. I am delighted to enroll you
in our Tribe. ‘I have an errand to thee, O captain.’” He
smiled. “The Tribe is a military organization, a mighty
host. And we need captains to spread the word.”</p>

<p>The Headman shook hands warmly with both Hamilton
and Pinkney. Griffith, who had been leaning back in a
chair, arose and followed his example.</p>

<p>“Let us be seated.” Robert noticed how the Headman’s
eyes glowed, how the corners of his lips turned down and
how he habitually pressed the tips of his fingers together.
A sincere man, a man fairly burning with religious zeal.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
“In recruiting this magnificent army that is to bear the
message of the Trick Track Tribe to every portion of the
continent, we are in need of captains, even as the Kings of
Israel needed captains of their hundreds.”</p>

<p>He complimented Robert magnificently on fighting the
hosts of the enemy and now girding up his loins again to
renew the fight for godliness here.</p>

<p>Robert, he judged, did not know all about the Tribe, but
he must take some of its mission on faith. No doubt he
knew its main objects. White supremacy. Noah had begot
Shem, Ham and Japheth. God had created men, black and
<span class="lock">white—</span>the white to be supreme, the black to be ruled. The
purity of womanhood. Men and women who feared God
and who kept His commandments. Patriotism. Something
about money changers in the Temple.</p>

<p>Griffith, whose quick eye had been traveling back and
forth between the minister and Robert, leaned forward and
pointed his finger at the desk.</p>

<p>“It’s this way, Hamilton,” he said. “Pinkney has probably
told you and I’ve said something about <span class="lock">it—</span>we’re planning
our big drive, to expand simultaneously all over the
country. We need men of standing to organize branches.
We want to hit the big places in the North. Chicago and
St. Louis are important centers now, because a lot of niggers
have been imported there during the war. Chicago seems
to be the logical center for the Middle West. We’ve had
a man there for a few weeks looking over the field, and
we’d <span class="lock">like—</span>that is, we would be delighted to have you accept
a position as a Grand <span class="lock">Bogey—</span>that’s a district manager.
You’d work out of Chicago. There’s an office there now
under a different <span class="lock">name—</span>the Dearborn Statistical Bureau.”</p>

<p>Pinkney rose.</p>

<p>“Well, I simply wanted to bring Captain Hamilton here.
I don’t suppose you need me any more.” They didn’t,
thanked him profusely, and he left. The Headman listened
to Griffith for a while and then turned to another desk,
where he worked over some papers.</p>

<p>Robert was to employ lesser Bogeys or sales managers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
under <span class="lock">him—</span>division Bogeys for states, regimental for
cities.</p>

<p>“Now,” Griffith coughed and looked uneasy. “As for
the matter of compensation. We realize that no matter
how inspired a person’s motives may be, he can’t do his
best work without remuneration. So I’ve devised a plan
whereby our sales managers, that is our Bogeys, are able
to carry on their splendid work and at the same time make
a good thing of it.”</p>

<p>Mr. Lister looked up from his work, pursed his lips
together and nodded importantly.</p>

<p>“The laborer is worthy of his reward,” he said.</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s it exactly,” agreed Griffith.</p>

<p>The reward was to be fifty cents for each new member.
The initiation fee was $10.00. Of this the Bogey who
actually sold the membership, or rather, gained the recruit,
kept $4.00, the division Bogey kept $1.00 and the Grand
Bogey fifty cents. Of course, the Grand Bogey would have
twenty or thirty lesser Bogeys working under him, and
although the recompense on each sale, or rather new <span class="lock">membership—</span>Griffith
<em>would</em> drift back into the terminology of
<span class="lock">salesmanship—</span>would be less, his total profits would be
greater. Thus out of the $10.00, more than half, or $5.50,
would go to the various Bogeys, and $4.50 was to be forwarded
to the Commander Bogey, who was Griffith. If
Robert actually sold the memberships himself, he would
keep the other Bogey’s share. Then there was the mask,
which was sold for $6.50, and the horse robe, $14.00; water
for the initiation ceremony, at $10.00 a quart, and so forth,
all of which brought their share of profit.</p>

<p>Robert wondered whether Pinkney was familiar with all
these financial details of the organization, whether his father
knew about it, whether the other citizens of Corinth who
had discussed it so glowingly as a sort of new church
sprung up. Well, one had to be practical. The main thing
was to get a number of Americans united in a common
purpose, and it took money to do these things. The contractors
who had undertaken the undoubtedly patriotic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
work of building the army cantonments during the war had
made profits. There was no use being a sentimentalist.
Even the directors of charity drives received compensation
for their <span class="lock">work—</span>often handsome <span class="lock">compensation—</span>and who
could deny that raising money for charity was a good thing.
True, if the Hamilton Corporation had not failed, Robert
would not have accepted the position as Grand Bogey,
except, perhaps, without compensation. But now he must
be practical. He had been in Chicago only once before in
his life, as a boy, and it would be interesting to see it again.
It had changed a great deal. And then, too, he would
have a chance to see McCall and Levin. Dorothy, too!</p>

<p>“I suppose you’ll join the American Legion,” said
Griffith.</p>

<p>“Yes. We’re just forming a post here, but I suppose I
might as well join in Chicago now.”</p>

<p>“Fine,” said Griffith. “This is a military organization,
you see. We want to get that element into it. How soon
can you leave?”</p>

<p>Robert considered.</p>

<p>“Almost any time. There is nothing really to hinder me
at all. In a week, say, if you want me to.”</p>

<p>“The sooner the better. I’ll have Mrs. Ward fix you
up with a supply of propaganda materials. I see you’ve
got a copy of The Clarion. Of course, you understand,
The Clarion’s published by The Clarion Publishing Company.
But it’s all good stuff. Read the article about the
Catholics.”</p>

<p>“Is that true about the Knights of Columbus trying to
control politics in this country?”</p>

<p>Griffith laughed.</p>

<p>“Read some of the stuff we’ve prepared. There’s a pamphlet
by Prof. Lorner that’s a knockout, positively a knockout.
And you want to read the K. C. oath.”</p>

<p>Griffith and the Rev. Mr. Lister shook hands with him.
Mrs. Ward was directed to get a complete Grand Bogey’s
layout ready and a few pieces of literature were thrust into
his hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span></p>

<p>“We’ll run you through the other degrees so you can
qualify for a Grand Bogey,” said Griffith. “We’re getting
another young <span class="lock">captain—</span>good family, good <span class="lock">mixer—</span>for New
York. Keep your eyes peeled for recruits. Drop in again
tomorrow at this time. And read this literature. It’s
good ammunition.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XXVII"><abbr title="Twenty-seven">XXVII</abbr></h2>
</div>

<p>It was the last week in June and hot. No rain for a
fortnight, a blistering sun and the clay roads leading to
Corinth were baked to a bricklike hardness. Black gardeners
perspired to keep their lawns green, the leaves of
trees looked dry and yellowish, the wealthy began moving
north. Robert longed for Chicago and Lake Michigan.
Out of deference to Margaret and his parents he had postponed
his departure until after the Fourth. There had
been farewell luncheons and parties in his honor. He had
spoken before the local Rotary club. And, crowning glory,
he was now to make one of the Fourth of July addresses
at Peachtree Park! Griffith, at first eager to have Robert
off, saw the advantage to the Tribal cause in having their
new Grand Bogey appear in public, and heartily approved.</p>

<p>When Griffith called to inform Robert that 500 Tribesmen
were to parade through the little village of Carthage
that afternoon, Robert begged off. His real reason was,
first, because it was hot and, second, because he had paraded
enough in the army. It was all right for Pinkney and
Griffith to trot around in sepulchral robes and masks, but
after a man has marched some thousands of miles more or
less in military formations and taken part in a hundred
regimental parades, guard mounts and what not, the novelty
wears off.</p>

<p>“I’m working on my speech,” Robert offered a gray lie.
It was partly true.</p>

<p>“Oh, fine, fine!” You could see Griffith nodding, through
the phone. “That’s all right. Make it a good one! It’s
more important.” He explained the object of the parade.
It was simply to impress with the power of the Tribe the
half hundred Negroes who lived in the village and of
whom some white folk had made complaint. What had
they done? They were acting up. A few had been drinking.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
One had been caught stealing. Some of the young
bucks appeared to be loafing, hanging around the streets
without having anything to do. Oh, yes, they had been
punished, and without any waste of time, by the judge.
But it was feared that if they got too gay, something
more serious might happen. The mulattoes especially were
feared. They were naturally bad. This would simply be
a reminder, a salutary warning. An ounce of prevention,
you know.</p>

<p>Then, shortly before six, Margaret had called up, all
excitement.</p>

<p>“Have you heard about the parade at Carthage?”</p>

<p>“Yes, why?”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you go? It was wonderful! So solemn
and majestic, like a troop of knights going forth in the
defense of womanhood.”</p>

<p>No, indeed! She had not gone. She had heard about
it from Pinkney. Pinkney, in fact, had wondered why
Robert wasn’t taking more active interest in the Tribal
matters. Robert was nettled.</p>

<p>“I’ve been working on my speech.”</p>

<p>“Oh.” Then some details of how frightened the Negroes
had been, and “Marjorie and Betty are coming over tonight.
Would you care to—? No, well then, I’ll see you
tomorrow. Good night!”</p>

<p>Robert spent the evening reading patriotic addresses,
making notes of the more striking passages, wondering
about Margaret and drinking ice water. His parents’ voices
drifted pleasantly up to him from the porch through the
open windows.</p>

<p>He yawned and looked out. He was becoming restless.
Through the heavily scented trees the moon glimmered and
a faint breeze stirred. He remembered that he had not sent
the poem to Dorothy as he had intended and decided to
take it with him. The vines in front of the window
swished softly.</p>

<p>He shut his book, turned off the light and went downstairs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span></p>

<p>“I’m going out for a little ride,” he said. “I’ll be back
early. But don’t sit up for me.”</p>

<p>“All right, son.”</p>

<p>Driving along the country roads, at any rate, would be
cooler than sitting up there. Phrases from the speeches
he had read ran through his mind. It was good to see the
long road, silver in the moonlight, unwind before him. The
wind soothed him, coolly. He stepped on the accelerator
and reveled in the sensation of flying through the night.
The yellow lights of Carthage twinkled ahead and he slowed
up. He bumped across a plank bridge. Then a mill, a
church, some dreary shops. Shanties. The sinister jail.
What were so many people doing in the street? Their
voices were buzzing. Shouting. He slowed down.</p>

<p>“Hey, they all goin’,” someone yelled. A tall, lanky form
leaned excitedly over the side of the car. His voice
twanged. It was an old face, wrinkled, and his goatee went
up and down.</p>

<p>“Who’s gone?” Robert stopped his car.</p>

<p>“They all. They bin skeered stiff, a’ter them Tribesmen
p’raded through town this a’ternoon. Every blessed last
one of them damned niggers packed up thayr belongings
and skip’d. Wall, good riddance of ’em!”</p>

<p>Other villagers came up excitedly.</p>

<p>“The only wan who misses ’em is the real estater who
rented ’em thayr shanties,” someone laughed shrilly.</p>

<p>“They all packed up an’ git.”</p>

<p>“Hurry up, mister, and you all kin see ’em. They’re just
adown the road a piece. Reckon they’ll be goin’ to Colby
and they’re sneakin’ in a’ night so the whites don’ see ’em.”
The crowd laughed.</p>

<p>Robert sounded his siren, the crowd gave way, talking
and laughing, and he pushed slowly through the straggling
main street into the country again. A mile away, at the
top of a crest, he came upon the last of the <span class="lock">column—</span>a
fleshy, gray-haired mammy with a basket full of household
utensils on her head. One arm was raised to support it,
while the other held a cane with which she felt her way.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
Beside her another old woman waddled, an infant in her
arms and a pickaninny of perhaps three trailing at her
ragged skirt.</p>

<p>They were taking the cross-road and now the whole
ragged, pathetic procession could be seen at the top of the
crest, from the tall, broad-shouldered bucks guarding the
mule carts in the front to the two old women in the rear.
The moon, round and bright, fell on their exodus and
painted them into a column of shadows, with bowed heads,
moving slowly onward. The fence rails of a field were
down. Robert dimmed his lights, parked his car beside the
road, jumped out and cut across the field to a clump of
bushes. The mules thudded slowly, switching their flanks,
along the clay. Harness slapped from side to side, wagon
wheels creaked. In the wagons were stoves, beds, the
heavier articles of furniture and the sick. Everyone carried
<span class="lock">something—</span>enormous bundles, worn suitcases. A tattered
youth in overalls and undershirt, staggered beneath a
soldier’s haversack and roll, piled high and strapped to his
shoulders, and pulled a toy express wagon filled with rattling
kitchenware.</p>

<p>Stolid men with brown faces and fear in their eyes.
Weeping women. A ragged preacher moaning at the top
of his voice and invoking “De Lor’ Jehovah.” Sorrowful,
musical voices responding. Children crying. A woman
moaning. A pregnant woman, with set mouth, pulling a
mulatto child by the hand. A child with high nose and
thin lips, but bearing the brand of <span class="lock">Canaan—</span>woolly hair and
dark skin. There they marched, black, brown, <span class="lock">yellow—</span>negroes
and <span class="lock">mulattoes—</span>their entire wealth wrapped in these
rude bundles.</p>

<p>The mulatto child. It haunted him. Soft, wondering
eyes in the moonlight, looking up at its mother. An idea,
a grotesque idea, came to Robert. What mob had howled
about the faggot pile of the father of this half-breed child?
What white-robed knights had paraded before his door
in warning? No! He had been white. And, a horrible
thought, perhaps some white father, sometime, somewhere,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
unknowingly, of course, had paraded in warning before the
home of his half-breed son or, it was conceivable, had
kindled the flames about his brown limbs! Moonlight and
the shadows moving on.</p>

<p>A tall, straight-shouldered negro leaned forward against
a push cart, overflowing with bedding and on top of which
rode a gray-haired, sobbing woman. He was comforting
her, crooning to her as one might to a terrified child. His
eyes turned toward the row of bushes and a memory burned
in Robert’s brain. Who was it? Where had he seen him?
Was it? Was it the black who had saved his life? The
pale light fell full on his <span class="lock">features—</span>the high cheek bones,
the slightly thickened lips. No, thank God! No, it was
not Williams. No, it was not Williams!</p>

<p>Robert turned, ran back across the field and jumped into
his car without looking around. What if it had been Williams?
Why couldn’t it have been? He sped through the
village. The crowd had dispersed into smaller groups that
gossiped in doorways and porches.</p>

<p>The east room was lit when Robert drove the car into
the garage. Laughing voices drifted out to him. He stole
up the back way into his room. He wanted to be alone.
The moon sent moving black masses interlaced with silver
upon the walls. Robert hurriedly switched on the lights.
As the door closed, a paper on the table rose and fell. His
notes for the Fourth of July oration. Land of freedom.
Washington, Jefferson, Jackson. Independence of tyranny.—It
must be hell to be a nigger.</p>

<p>It was too gruesome to tell about at the breakfast table
the next morning, but in the afternoon Robert described the
flight of the Negroes of Carthage. They were walking about
in the garden.</p>

<p>“My God, dad, if I had ever known what was coming,
I’d never have joined the Tribe!”</p>

<p>“Well, son, the Tribe wasn’t really responsible. They
simply wanted to warn the Negroes to be careful, to be
law-abiding. They thought that they would be impressed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
but I’m sure that even Griffith didn’t imagine anything like
that.”</p>

<p>“But, God, it was horrible, weird, like something out of
the dark ages. Even a slave-owner wouldn’t do a thing
like that.”</p>

<p>“No, certainly not, no decent man would. But, Bob, they
didn’t mean it. They wanted to prevent something worse.
There have been too many lynchings in Corinth lately and
we want to prevent that.”</p>

<p>Robert’s face was flushed.</p>

<p>“Dad, I don’t know. This is simply one example, just
one example of what the Tribe means. We have our
tribunal. We decide a man’s guilt. But we’re all in masks.
We’<span class="lock">re—</span>we’re a tribe. Not a law court. We may try
to be, but we’re dealing with justice like savages. Our
courts may be slow, imperfect; but anyway, they keep us
from being a mob like that, or a tribe. Think of the hundreds
of years during which human wisdom has built up
our laws and our court procedure.” He was conscious
of footsteps coming up the walk. “Why do we need any
other tribunal than our own courts? Why do we need
a Tribe to try men? It’s natural that the Tribal concilium
should be swayed by prejudices and fears and hatreds. In
the courts, justice is regulated by laws, by precedent, by
the wisdom of ages. In the Tribe, it is the moment’s <span class="lock">sentiment—</span>right
or <span class="lock">wrong—</span>sympathy or hate or revenge.
Tribesmen may think they’re impartial, but they’re men,
acting with only their own wisdom, often acting unwisely,
sometimes cruelly. <span class="lock">I—</span>I think that I’ll resign from the
Tribe!”</p>

<p>His father cleared his throat and held up his hand.
Robert looked around. It was Margaret, dark eyes ablaze,
cheeks flushed, hands clenched.</p>

<p>“So you will resign from the Tribe?” She tossed back
her head. Her voice was clear, impassioned. “You will
turn against the only force that can preserve the white
South and white America from the alien? I thought you
were a soldier. Don’t you see where your duty lies?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span></p>

<p>“But Margaret, I’m not opposing—”</p>

<p>“You are,” she cried. “If you are not with the Tribe in
its crusade, you are against it. It was the same way in the
war. You were either a one hundred per cent American
or you weren’t an American. And now you are either for
one hundred per cent Christian, white civilization or
against it.”</p>

<p>“<span class="lock">Why—</span>where—?”</p>

<p>She went on: “The Trick Track Tribe is only a test.
It shows how you stand. Don’t ask me how I know.
<span class="lock">Someone—</span>yes, <span class="lock">Howard—</span>said the Tribe is going to show
exactly where every man in the South stands. Every man
who isn’t a member by the time the drive is over, isn’t a
member for some good <span class="lock">reason—</span>and it isn’t a reason to be
proud of.” Her voice choked. She raised her hands and
began fumbling at the engagement ring, then suddenly let
them fall again, her fists still clenched. Her nostrils quivered.
Robert could hear her breathing.</p>

<p>“<span class="lock">I—</span>I don’t want my husband to belong to the class that
isn’<span class="lock">t—</span>isn’t—” Her voice broke. She turned suddenly and
hurried up the walk into the house.</p>

<p>“<span class="lock">Why—</span>why?” Robert stared after her. What had he
said? What had he done? Was resigning from the Tribe
some form of treason or <span class="lock">heresy—</span>or infidelity?</p>

<p>The older man laughed.</p>

<p>“She’s got a temper, regular daughter of Dixie!”</p>

<p>“But did I say anything to make her flare up like that?
Can’t a man quit an organization if he wants to?”</p>

<p>“I guess not. Not if you want Margaret.”</p>

<p>“But what has that got to do with <span class="lock">me—</span>with us? It’<span class="lock">s—</span>it’s
unreasonable!”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, when you have as many gray hairs as I have,
you’ll learn that the most reasonable thing to expect of a
woman is unreasonableness. Suit your own conscience.
But—” he put his arm on his son’s shoulder, “but don’t take
it so hard. Just think it over.”</p>

</div>

<p>Robert was on his way to Chicago, with his credentials
as Grand Bogey of the Trick Track Tribe secure in his
breast pocket. In a large, black leather bag were his propaganda
supplies, booklets and cards about the black peril,
the yellow peril, the political activities of the Knights of
Columbus, the Jewish problem, the menace of foreign immigration.
He had scarcely time to look at them. Most of
his supplies had, of course, been sent by express directly to
the office of the Dearborn Statistical Bureau.</p>

<p>Before leaving Corinth, Griffith and Lister had both
given him a new conception of the scope of the Trick Track
Tribe. Its sphere had been called the Fourth Dimension,
because like the fourth dimension it was to be invisible to
outsiders, yet it was to form a part of the entire political,
economic and social fabric of the country. It was to support
good government against bad, combat radicalism and
immorality, uphold the best traditions of Anglo-Saxon civilization.
The Bogeys were to go forth like knights of old,
except that they were to work unseen, in the Fourth Dimension,
fighting for God and their country.</p>

<p>Robert had been provided with a number of cards to distribute
among his <span class="lock">prospects—</span>cards resembling those which
he had received, with the motto <i lang="la">Non Silba Sed Anthra</i> on
them. Griffith had suggested that he begin proselytising on
the train, and accordingly Robert studied his fellow passengers.</p>

<p>“Get the young fellows,” Griffith had advised. “As
many of the ex-service men as you can and of fellows who
weren’t drafted, but who would like to get in with men
who were in the army. In the cities, of course, you’ll have
to work systematically. First, get a few of the big guns: a
big minister, a public official, a prominent business man.
Then you can use their names in getting the rest. But on
the train I’d try the young fellows.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span></p>

<p>In the smoking car Robert tried to manipulate the conversation
so as to sound the feelings of the men with whom
he conversed. Everyone, of course, approved of such a
generalization as Americanism, although each had his own
solution of his idea of what that problem constituted.</p>

<p>“What we need is to get down to work and do less shouting,”
was one choleric old gentleman’s rather vague recipe.</p>

<p>A drummer from <span class="lock">Chicago—</span>big cigar, diamond stickpin,
dominant joviality and a talent for smutty <span class="lock">stories—</span>denounced
the <span class="lock">Bolsheviki—</span>but his nose was Semitic and his
name was something with a “son” on the end of it.</p>

<p>The thin, blond man with horn-rimmed <span class="lock">spectacles—</span>an
advertising copywriter on his way back to Chicago from a
<span class="lock">vacation—</span>said business was unusually good, it was simply
a problem of going after it. None of them, in fact, had
felt that the integrity of the American nation was being
subverted. They were hopelessly optimistic.</p>

<p>When he referred to the Negro question, two men who
were from the South began to take interest. One was an
old <span class="lock">gentleman—</span>he seemed at least seventy-<span class="lock">five—</span>the other,
a young man, perhaps Robert’s junior by three years, on
his first trip <span class="lock">north—</span>to Louisville.</p>

<p>“That’s a real problem,” said the young man, taking part
in the conversation for the first time that evening. “Some
times I think they should all be shipped over to <span class="lock">Africa—</span>the
whole bunch of ’em. Send ’em to Liberia. Africa’s the
place for ’em all.”</p>

<p>He related an incident of how a Negro had stolen a hen
from an uncle’s roost. A policeman, with a sense of humor,
saw the darkey waddling down the street, suspiciously fat.</p>

<p>“Good-evening, Rastus,” said the policeman. “Nice evening.”
It was the first time in his life that a policeman
had ever said “good evening” to him, or, in fact, any
white man.</p>

<p>“Yes, sah, pow’ful fine evenin’,” said the nigger uneasily,
trying to conceal the hen, make a getaway and be
polite to the guardian of the law at the same time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span></p>

<p>“You’re looking fine,” said the policeman, playfully prodding
him. “Wife’s cooking must agree with you.”</p>

<p>“Yes, pow’ful fine cooking. I gain thuty pound in one
week. But I must be going home. I heah de poke chops
frying on de pan and a-calling me. Good-night.”</p>

<p>At this moment the hen began to cackle.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” cried the patrolman.</p>

<p>“Tuck-tuck-a-wack!!”</p>

<p>“I’se just imitatin’ a chicken clackin’. (Tuck-tuck, tuck,
tuck awah’)—hear dat? Folks says I’se de bes’ natural
bo’n animal imetator in de—(Tuck, tuck, a wack.) Some
folks say it’s a gift to imetate an animal so natural. Folks
say I imetate better than the animal itself.—(Tuck, tuck a
wack.)”</p>

<p>“I think if you unbuttoned your coat you could give a
much better imitation.”</p>

<p>“No, <em>sah</em>! I must have it tight around my abdomen to
get de true, natural soun’. (Tuck, a, luck.)”</p>

<p>The darky’s coat was agitated by the struggling hen, a
button popped off and the bird suddenly thrust its head into
view. Rastus slowly scratched his head.</p>

<p>“Now whare do you t’ink dat come from? I <em>thought</em> I
was givin’ an onusually fine impersonation.”</p>

<p>Everyone laughed.</p>

<p>“They’re awfully funny, those coons,” said the young
man. “You-all ought to see them jigging in the moonlight,
playing on their banjos and dancing, all impromptu. It
beats any minstrel show you-all ever saw. And they have
beautiful voices. But they will lie and steal.”</p>

<p>He became serious.</p>

<p>“Of course, every race has its good sides, but the nigger
has got to go, or else there won’t be any white America.
In the meantime, he’s got to be kept in his place. He’s got
to learn to respect the white man. Why, I read just the
other day where they’re four million mulattoes in this
country.”</p>

<p>“Well,” remarked the advertising man, dryly, “you know
where they come from.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span></p>

<p>He winked at the other Northerners, with a slight feeling
of belonging to a superior group.</p>

<p>“What d’ye mean?”</p>

<p>“Well, the mulattoes come from either black mothers or
white mothers. Therefore—”</p>

<p>The young Southerner grew very red.</p>

<p>“Sir, do you mean to insinuate that any white woman
of the South—”</p>

<p>“Certainly not. I must say that I found the standards
of morality in the South higher even than in Chicago or
in the little Northern village where I was born. No, sir,
the mulattoes are born in the South of black mothers. They
are born among the purest, highest type of Anglo-Saxon
manhood, upholding its traditions of race, religion and
womanhood. I haven’t the least idea who their fathers
are.”</p>

<p>The young man’s eyes blazed. Hamilton felt himself
growing angry, but before he could say anything, the young
man had half risen and was striking his palm excitedly
with his fist.</p>

<p>“Sir,” he was crying, “you’ve made an insinuation against
an entire class.”</p>

<p>He sputtered, he became unintelligible. He was going
to make the other man eat his words. He denied that any
respectable Southerner had ever begotten a mulatto child.
Poor whites, perhaps. White trash! A white gentleman
would never touch a colored woman.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the advertising man, with the least bit of a
twinkle, “I hadn’t the least idea that I was insulting you.
But what is your idea of the phenomenon?”</p>

<p>The youth glowered. The choleric old gentleman thrust
in his oar.</p>

<p>“Why! Why! I observed that it was quite common for
young gentlemen to ‘touch’ black women. In fact, I got
the idea that it was one of your Southern traditions. Why,
look here, young man, I’ve talked to twenty overseers if
I’ve talked to one, and they all told me the same thing.
They certainly extended true Southern hospitality to me.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
He went into details. “Why, damn it, they admitted doing
it themselves, not with any feeling of making a confession,
either. One overseer said he always went to another plantation
so as not to spoil the morale of his help!</p>

<p>“Now, I don’t give a whoop what you do. Black, brown,
red. It’s none of my business. But what I do hate is this
damn hypocrisy, all this bunk about your splendid manhood
and high morality. Doggone it, I’ll bet you can’t show me
a single white man south of the Mason-Dixon line—”</p>

<p>The young man flung his cigarette on the floor and walked
out of the smoking car, muttering that if the Northerner
weren’t old enough to be his grandfather he’d mop the car
up with him.</p>

<p>Hamilton rose. “Here’s one, right here!” he said, looking
the choleric gentleman in the eye.</p>

<p>“An exception, all right. But without getting mad about
it and without putting on a high and mighty pose, tell me
truthfully, aren’t you an exception? Take your own
set!”</p>

<p>Hamilton wavered. The standards in Corinth had not
been very high. Perhaps the set he knew was not a fair
group. In general, it had not been considered particularly
immoral. It had been the attitude of Greek or Roman
gentlemen to their slaves.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, “perhaps the white man is to blame. To
be frank, I guess we are. Yes, it is a serious situation, and
that’s exactly what we must combat.” He wished that the
Jewish drummer were out of the car. It was a fine opening
to talk Tribe. He could tell what the Tribe was going to
do to raise moral standards and prevent the mingling of
white blood with black by rigid enforcement of the code.
Why were Jews excluded from membership, anyway?</p>

<p>The old Southerner coughed.</p>

<p>“I haven’t taken any part in your little argument, yet,”
he said, stroking his long white beard, “for I reckon that’s
something for younger and fightinger folks. But they say:
Young men for fightin’ and old men for counsel. I sort<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
o’ figgered that you fellows was sort of teasing this youngster
that got mad.”</p>

<p>“Sure, that’s all I was doing, dad, having a little fun
with him,” said the ad man. “Have a cigar?”</p>

<p>“No, thanks. Had enough. Too much tobacco bad for
my heart. I sort-a liked the spunk o’ that young fella at
that. Although nobody would a got mad at a thing like
that in my day. But he’s right and you, too, young man.
The nigger problem is a coming one. It’s been under cover
for many years, but it’ll bob up again, sure as you’re born.
Now, you might not know it, but I fit with the boys in
gray; ’listed in ’65. I was a youngster, but I got in. I
got a wound in my right thigh by a Yank musketball, I can
show you, in the last engagement of the <span class="lock">war—</span>but I’ve no
feelings against the North for that. Not any more. No,
the South has forgotten the war. We’re all one country
now.”</p>

<p>He went into a circumlocutory account of his experiences
in the Civil War, of his home-coming and of the first post
bellum days, while the rest listened respectfully and asked
questions from time to time <a id="chg1"></a>to show that they were still interested.</p>

<p>“You’re wondering where all this is leading to, well, you
were talking about the nigger problem. But I saw a real
nigger problem, compared to which this one isn’t a hill o’
beans. No, sir, not a hill o’ beans. Although this one may
get to be like it. But we had a real problem.”</p>

<p>It was after the war. The Southern States had been
compelled reluctantly, not merely to liberate, but to enfranchise
the Negroes. Yankee carpetbaggers had descended
from the North, both to invest money in enterprises and
real estate that could be bought for a song and to obtain
political control.</p>

<p>“Well, I lived in Tennessee, little town of Pulaski. When
we got back, a few of us young bucks got together one May
day in 1866, and formed a secret society, just for the
dickens of it. I don’t know if you ever heard of it—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span></p>

<p>“You don’t mean them Ku Kluxers?” broke in the Jewish
drummer.</p>

<p>“That’s right!” exclaimed the old gentleman joyously.
“How did you know? Knights of the Ku Klux Klan we
called ourselves. Kuklux was a Latin word, meaning circle,
and one of the boys who’d been to college thought it’d be
appropriate.”</p>

<p>“Oh, ‘kuklos’! That’s Greek for circle,” said Hamilton.</p>

<p>“Oh, everyone has heard of the Ku Klux Klan,” put in
the advertising man. “We even read about it in our histories,
dad.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s the same Klan, and I was one of the first
members. Well, our first object was just to have a little
fun, a little mystery to keep the other folks guessing. Then,
by accident, someone discovered that if you wanted to scare
a nigger into doing what you wanted him to do, all you
had to do was to dress up in a sheet like a ghost.</p>

<p>“We scared a few bad niggers. You should have seen
our rigs. White masks, high cardboard hats, long white
robes. And we had a white cover for our horses and
padded their feet. The best fun, of course, was the initiations.
But that’s all secret.” He chuckled at the memory.</p>

<p>“Soon other Klans were started around Pulaski. By an’
by Tennessee, and then the entire South was covered with
them. So by the time the reconstruction acts o’ ’67 were
passed, we had a right smart of a military organization.
Why, sir, the niggers, the old slaves, were in the state
militia and we had to walk between rows of their bayonets
to get at the voting polls. They and the Northern carpetbaggers
stuffed the ballot boxes and won over the state
and city government. And there were a few scalawags
from the South that joined ’em. We had organized just
for fun. But as soon as the niggers and carpetbaggers
began making our laws and robbin’ the public treasury, the
Klan spread like wildfire over the entire South. And like
organizations were also formed. Knights of the White
Camellia was one, Pale Faces, White Leaguers.”</p>

<p>“Trick Track Tribe,” suggested Hamilton.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, that was one of ’em. But they all had one <span class="lock">purpose—</span>to
uphold the supremacy of the white race.”</p>

<p>“Well, you made a good job of it,” said someone. The
old gentleman was getting winded.</p>

<p>“Yes, we did. Tar and feathers. Public hangings. A
few judicious notes o’ warnin’. We put the fear o’ God
and respect for law and order in their souls. It might not
of been strictly ethical, but it worked in its day, and if ever
the niggers start kickin’ up a rumpus, the same thing can
be used against ’em again.”</p>

<p>The Jewish drummer took out another cigar and cut off
the end with a little gold cigar-cutter attached to a chain
and Robert knew that he would have to bide his time. The
old gentleman’s words had given him moral confirmation.
Not that he needed it, exactly, but it established the Tribe
as of honorable tradition, an institution of which any
Southerner could be proud. He wished that the Jewish
drummer would go, or at least that he would get a chance
to talk to the old Klansman alone. When the latter, therefore,
excused himself to return to his seat because the
smoke was getting too thick for his lungs, Robert followed
him.</p>

<p>“I was interested in what you said about the Trick Track
Tribe,” he said, falling into the seat opposite him.</p>

<p>“That’s because you’re a Southerner. Every loyal
Southerner is.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you’ll be glad to know that <span class="lock">we—</span>that the Tribe
is being revived.”</p>

<p>“Revived? Well, well, well. But you know it was run
out of business by the law, the whole shooting match of
’<span class="lock">em—</span>Klan, Tribe and all, by Congress.”</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t know that. Let’s see! There was something
like that in our American history. Let’s see, the
Force bill.”</p>

<p>“Sure thing. The damn Yankee general, Grant, done it.
So I wouldn’t say much about it. I suppose it’s still
illegal.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, this has been reorganized and incorporated,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
although it’s got the same name and the same traditions.
Here, let me show you some of our cards.”</p>

<p>The old Confederate soldier puzzled over the Latin motto
and demanded why all those questions were being asked.</p>

<p>“We didn’t ask all them questions about religion and
where a man was born. An’ what’s this card?”</p>

<p>It was a card the size of a playing card, headed “Do
You Know?” and containing a list of “that’s”:</p>

<p>“D’you take me fer a fool, young feller? And what’s
this other card there, some more anti-Catholic stuff, eh?
What in the devil has this rigmarole got to do with the old
Tribe or the Klan or with any of those other organizations?
How d’you know <em>I’m</em> not a Catholic?”</p>

<p>“I thought because you belonged to the Ku Klux Klan
you couldn’t be. I thought Jews and Catholics were
barred.”</p>

<p>“Jews. Catholics barred.” His eyes blazed and he shook
his fist. “Now where do you get that? I want you to
know that some of the finest soldiers among the boys in
gray was Irish Catholics. A lot of the officers, too. And
don’t you know that a Jew, Judah P. Benjamin, was secretary
of war of the Confederate States? And the Pope of
Rome was the only power that recognized our president and
government? You’re a fine Southerner! No, we didn’t
discriminate because of religion. Didn’t you hear me tell
you that we had just come back from the Civil War and
that we all united to save the South from ignorant, licentious
niggers and from crooked Yank carpetbaggers and
our own Southern scalawags? There wasn’t any question
of Catholics or Protestants or Jews in the old Tribe.
There wasn’t any question of Catholic or Jew in the Ku
Klux Klan. I’m not a Catholic, but if you’re a friend of
the old Tribe or the old Ku Klux Klan don’t show me
any more of that stuff.”</p>

<p>Robert put his cards back in embarrassment. The old
gentleman kept mumbling “Catholic, Jews, Klan” under his
breath.</p>

<p>“Oh, of course,” began Robert, “our chief purpose is
to preserve the white race—”</p>

<p>“Preserve! You mean pickle it! Kill it and pickle it in
embalming fluid! So you’re going to preserve it by splitting
it up. In ’67 we tried to preserve it from the unruly
blacks and the renegade whites. If you’d been there, young
man, you’d of known how important it was to have the
best of the white element <span class="lock">united—</span>instead of dividing it
along religious lines.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span></p>

<p>Robert attempted to point out the need of having a
homogeneous organization of native-born, white Protestants
to carry on these ideals, but the old man swore that “there
had been Protestant, white-born native sons of Belial among
the scalawags.”</p>

<p>“There’s no race or creed that’s got a monopoly on all
the scoundrels. And I notice you slipped in a new one
about native-born. That, sir, is an insult! I’m Scotch
born! Came over as a boy of <span class="lock">six—</span>but that excludes me,
too, me a member of the first Klan. Why, Jesus Christ
himself couldn’t have gotten into your Tribe, according to
the revised rules, because: First, he was a foreigner, and,
second, because he was a Jew.”</p>

<p>Robert was becoming angry. If he wasn’t so old a man
and so vehement, one could argue with him, but when Robert
thought of something to say, he interrupted. He had
been more than picturesquely profane. He had been positively
sacrilegious. It would have been a feather in Robert’s
hat to have obtained the membership of one of the founders
of the Ku Klux <span class="lock">Klan—</span>but he wasn’t eligible, anyway. He
had never known the Scotch to be so vehement. He talked
like an excited Irishman. Robert would not tolerate it any
more. He got up and walked back to the smoking car.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XXIX"><abbr title="Twenty-nine">XXIX</abbr></h2>
</div>

<p>Robert went over his propaganda material. There was
no time to read all of it carefully, but enough to give him
a clearer idea of the Tribe’s purpose and to present, in
more clear-cut fashion, arguments for joining it. Its
objects had not appeared very plain. At the initiation, in
Griffith’s office, in talking with Lister, there seemed to be
a simple enough <span class="lock">mission—</span>Americanism, supremacy of
the white race, the maintenance of law and order, the avoidance
of unnecessary strikes, the protection of womanhood.
Yes, undoubtedly all this was a glorious task. But when
one came to analyze these general propositions their meaning
became vaguer. It was like founding a society to
uphold the Constitution. In 1787, before it was certain
whether a nationalistic sentiment would crystallize, there
might be some meaning in founding such a society. But
no one would think of forming such an association now.
And then Robert remembered that upholding the Constitution
was part of the Tribe’s creed. It was like establishing
an organization to uphold the foundation of our government.
It was like forming a <span class="lock">government—</span>only a secret
<span class="lock">government—</span>within a government.</p>

<p>Once, in his senior year at prep school, Robert had
attempted to become a debater. He joined a debating
society and was assigned to a team which was defending
the merits of a certain plank in the platform of the Bull
Moose party against a similar plank of the Democratic
party platform. He had entered the preparation of the
arguments full of enthusiasm. The Progressive platform
was so much broader, so much more constructive. Then,
on the night of the debate, his enthusiasm had suddenly
vanished. He had forgotten his arguments, or rather they
seemed petty. Each party was trying to solve the same
problem. There was merely a slight difference in the
phrasing. Each party had tried to word it as broadly as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
possible without committing itself too definitely. Robert
had rattled off the words he had memorized, sat down in
confusion for a moment and then walked out without waiting
for the verdict, which was, of course, against him.
That had ended his career as a debater. He had long forgotten
what the plank <span class="lock">was—</span>the handling of the trust problem,
relations between labor and capital, or what; but the
sense of mortification, mingled with one of his superiority
to persons who spent their time in trying to prove things,
remained.</p>

<p>The Tribe, he knew, was definitely opposed to the entry
of the Knights of Columbus in politics. Fair enough. He
was happy to be in that fight. But some of the questions
on the “Do You Know That” card seemed to be beside the
mark. They aimed at Catholics en masse, just like the
debaters at prep school had aimed questions and set traps
for their opponents, not to clarify the issue, but to win.
Granted that no religious organization ought to enter
American politics, why denounce the Catholics because the
Pope is enthroned and crowned, sends and receives
ambassadors and has 116 “princes” (bishops and higher
ecclesiastical officers presumably), in the United States?
That was begging the question. That was accusing the
Catholics of being Catholics, condemning them because of
the organization of their church. There was no proof
that the 116 papal princes had the remotest connection with
American politics. The suggestion was conveyed, of
course, by innuendo. Then there was a statement that the
Knights of Columbus had been the only sectarian or fraternal
body permitted to do war relief work in the army
and navy. That was a plain mis-statement. Any soldier
knew better than that. There were the Y. M. C. A. and
Salvation Army. And didn’t the Jews and the Lutherans
have some sort of organization? Yes, he was sure of it.
If the Y. M. C. A. and the Salvation Army were not considered
sectarian or fraternal organizations, then that was
only getting back to a debating society quibble on words.
Well, when he got to Chicago, he would talk it over with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
the man in charge of the Dearborn Statistical Bureau.
Together they would work out a better, yes, a fairer, set
of cards and circulars, some that actually pointed out the
menace of the Knights of Columbus in politics.</p>

<p>So far Robert had been fairly successful. At least five
of his fellow passengers had expressed a desire to join. He
had their names and addresses and would have cards sent
to them, one every week or so, so that it would not seem
that they were being rushed. One of the converts had
handed Robert a copy of a violently anti-Catholic publication
with a chuckle.</p>

<p>“Want to read something good?”</p>

<p>It was an account of how a Catholic priest had been
accused of intimate relations with a young girl who had
come to confess to him. The man winked and gleefully
expressed his indignation. His little dark eyes sparkled.</p>

<p>“They ought to all be wiped out root and stem,” he said
vehemently. “They’re all alike, with their round faces and
their fat stomachs. Every one. A bunch of hypocrites,
under the rule of an Eye-talian pot-entate, taxing the
people and living on the fat of the land. Why, it’s a well-known
fact that every priest has a cellar full of wine and
that they get drunk every night.”</p>

<p>He recited other “facts” and then appealed to history.
He had just read in a previous issue of the same publication
of the Spanish Inquisition.</p>

<p>“If they had the same power now they’d hold an inquisition
right here,” he declared. “They’re an intolerant lot
and if I had my way I’d make every one swear he wasn’t
a Catholic and those who wouldn’t swear, I’d hang.”</p>

<p>The defender of tolerance gleefully read the card Hamilton
handed him.</p>

<p>“Every word of that is true,” he repeated after every
statement. “Yes, sir, every word. Yes, sir, we demand
separation of church and state?”</p>

<p>For a moment the phrase “separation of church and
state” struck Hamilton as an odd <span class="lock">anachronism—</span>it was as
though he had demanded “no taxation without representation”—and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
then he remembered that that was one of the
purposes of the Tribe as outlined on the card. States’
rights was another one of the planks with a musty <span class="lock">flavor—</span>it
went back also to the Constitutional Convention, to gentlemen
in knee breeches and wigs ardently debating how much
of the power of the sovereign states was to be delegated to
the Confederation itself.</p>

<p>But the tolerant gentleman who wished to hang all Catholics
waxed enthusiastic over these demands and Hamilton
encouraged him.</p>

<p>The other converts were clerks or secretaries, the most
important of them the secretary of a commercial club of a
suburb of <span class="lock">Chicago—</span>Parkins, a short, blond, plump man,
with an engaging smile and a penchant for pep talks. He
wore rimless eye-glasses suspended by a gold chain, which
he frequently removed from his nose to breathe upon and
wipe with a silk handkerchief. Parkins had his eye, a
very pale one, on a bigger job, managing director of the
Chamber of Commerce of one of the more important cities
of the Mississippi Valley and systematically spoke before
various civic and commercial organizations. He had both
spoken and written for trade journals, house organs, etc.,
considerably more about the human will than Jonathan
Edwards and William James combined. His lectures, called
“The Will to Success” and “Selling Yourself Through Your
Will” were called “classics.” They were universally accepted,
emulated and followed.</p>

<p>Parkins went through a regular set of exercises in developing
the will every morning as ordinary <span class="lock">men—</span>now
and then, when it is not too late, or too cold or too <span class="lock">warm—</span>go
through setting-up exercises.</p>

<p>“I <em>will</em> get up and shut the window,” he would say the
first thing his eyes opened in the morning. Then Spartan-like
he would hop out, take three deep breaths and close
the window.</p>

<p>“I <em>will</em> take a cold shower,” he would say next. And soon
to the breakfast table.</p>

<p>“I <em>will</em> eat only one three-minute egg and one slice of unbuttered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
toast.... I <em>will</em> catch the 8:16 express, although
it is 8:12 now.... I <em>will</em> keep smiling no matter if I
must wait for the next train. Not failure, but low aim is
crime.... I <em>will</em> get through with my dictation by 10,
write my speech by 11 and get through the committee meeting
by 12.”</p>

<p>“It’s the little things that count,” said Parkins to Robert
with a smile. “To succeed in the big undertakings of life,
you must succeed in the smallest undertakings. I constantly
exercise my will. ‘Shall’ is the weakest word in the English
language. Always say ‘I Will,’ which is the strongest word.
The second strongest word is ‘Boost.’ Will to Boost! Boost
yourself! Boost your community! You know what Emerson
said about the mouse trap. If you construct a better
mouse trap or cause two blades of grass to wax where only
one grew before, the world will beat a highway to your
portal. The sublimest poem in the English language, second
perhaps to the Psalm of Life and, of course, the poetry
of the King James version of the Scriptures, is Invictus.
It means Unconquerable and is unquestionably one of the
greatest poems ever written by an American! It ends with
the immortal lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0b">‘Under the buffetings of Fate</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My head is bloody, but unbound.’</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Sublime! By the power of the will man is the captain of
his soul!”</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s wonderful,” agreed Hamilton, seizing an entering
wedge. “And don’t you think that just as the individual
should be the captain of his soul, the superior element,
the element of society that corresponds to the will, should
be the captain of the nation’s soul?” He had hit out blindly
at a figure of speech and it had come out surprisingly
smooth.</p>

<p>“That’s exactly right! I must make a mental note of that
thought. I will use it in my next address.”</p>

<p>Robert amplified on his original idea. The captain of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
ship of state, the metaphor warped slightly, was the best
<span class="lock">element—</span>the white, native-born Protestant. Parkins blew
on his glasses and said the thought was wonderful, if not
sublime. He added that we must steer away from the shoals
of foreign immigration.</p>

<p>“Chicago will need all its ‘I will’ spirit to solve the problem
that is now confronting it.” Robert wished that Parkins
would leave out a verb now and then, and not speak in a
succession of quotation marks and exclamation points.
“During the war, I am sorry to say, thousands of Negroes
came to Chicago to take their place beside the white man in
the factory, mill and shop.”</p>

<p>Parkins viewed the coming of the Negroes to Chicago,
East St. Louis and the other northern manufacturing cities
as a phenomenon akin to, say, the descent of locusts. The
fact that northern manufacturers made frantic efforts to
bring colored men by sending their agents into the South
and offering higher wages than they had ever received
before; the fact that this labor had been sorely needed in the
essential <span class="lock">industries—</span>to convert metal into guns and shells,
textiles into uniforms, leather into army shoes, food animals
into <span class="lock">meat—</span>he seemed to disregard. The Negroes had come,
as though they were a tribe of invaders or a visitation from
an angry god.</p>

<p>“We <em>will</em> dominate!” he said suddenly, pounding one
plump palm with a plump fist. “We native-born, white
Protestants, we <em>will</em> guide the ship of state. We <em>will</em> be
captains of our national soul. Hamilton, we must say it!
Listen to this: (He sang in a thumping, tuneless voice, under
his breath so that the others should not hear him, to the tune
of the Battle Hymn of the Republic:)</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0b">‘We <em>will</em> to be Americans</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In our land of Liberty.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We <em>will</em> to be-a loyal sons</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of the Bra-ave and the Free.’</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>That’s just the beginning of the song we sing every Tuesday
after our noon luncheon. Don’t you think it brings out your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
idea strongly? After it we sing ‘K-K-K-Katy,’ to take
away the psychological effect of singing such a serious song
and to leave them in a better mood. There is a great deal of
psychology about getting up a song-fest or an inspiration
meeting that the layman probably never realizes.”</p>

<p>He endorsed the Tribal idea in toto and became enthusiastic
over the phrase about doing away with unnecessary
strikes. (Robert glossed over the state’s rights idea as unimportant
anyway.)</p>

<p>“The alien and the Jew must be kept under control, too,”
said Parkins. Hamilton knew that Jews were ineligible for
membership, but had not read the pamphlet dealing with that
phase of propaganda and was uncertain whether they were
to be actually objects of attack, like the Negroes. In fact, it
was not quite clear to him whether Jews and Catholics were
to be lumped together with Negroes as undesirables or simply
to be attacked whenever they attempted to control the
government.</p>

<p>“In the little suburb where I chance to have found my
place,” said Parkins, “the Jews are already invading business.
They are bankers, merchants and professional men.
They are crowding out the dominant Protestant <span class="lock">element—</span>the
element that founded our little city and which still remains
the bulwark of its morality. Not satisfied with getting
a foothold into business there, as, I have no doubt, they are
doing everywhere else in this country, the Jews are bringing
their families into the most exclusive residential district and
cheapening it. They are like the camel in the little story,
which you have no doubt heard. It seems that an Arab in
crossing the Sahara had pitched his tent one night near a
beautiful and verdant oasis.”</p>

<p>He continued, with relatively few errors, the fable of the
camel, who, having been allowed by the Arab to stick its
head through the window of the tent, next entered through
the front door, and then gradually ousted the sheik from his
humble mat of rushes before the hearth.</p>

<p>“It was a mistake for our forefathers ever to open this
land of the free to all the nations of Europe to use as a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
dumping ground for their worst elements and as a breeding
place for un-Americanism and Radicalism. It is too bad
that the American party, I believe that was the name of that
splendid party that flourished in the middle of the last century,
should ever have been allowed to perish; and, if I
mistake not the pulse of the people, the revival of the Trick
Track Tribe will, in effect, also resurrect Americanism.”</p>

<p>Robert remembered hazily reading of the American party.
It had sometimes been referred to contemptuously by its
enemies as the Know Nothing party, and the oddity of the
name and the fact that it had been organized in Georgia had
emphasized it sufficiently to make it stick among the other
oddities of American political history in his brain. As they
discussed the old Know Nothing party, little details of it
came gradually back, and the resemblance between its platform,
drawn up before the Civil War, and the present platform
of the Trick Track Tribe struck him. One plank
restricted all political offices to native Americans. Another
would prevent persons swearing allegiance to any foreign
potentate or <span class="lock">power—</span>by George, almost the same phrasing!—from
office. A third would make it more difficult for aliens
to become naturalized, extending the residence requirement
to twenty-one years.</p>

<p>“The program of the Tribe <em>is</em> like the old American
party,” said Hamilton. “Why, there’s even something about
separation of church and state in it!”</p>

<p>“State’s rights” was another plank of the old Know Nothing
party. But here was something <span class="lock">peculiar—</span>the old plank,
allowing states to preserve institutions, had been drawn
(Robert remembered it distinctly now, both from his American
history class and from conversations at home), for the
purpose of preserving slavery. Had Griffith and Lister simply
lifted the old platform of the Know Nothing party?
Parkins, of course, would probably not remember the pro-slavery
sentiment behind the old states’ right plank. He was
always misquoting phrases. He had a prodigious capacity
for remembering things inaccurately. But, in general, Robert
wondered, would it be wise to speak to other Northerners<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
of the similarity of the Tribe’s program with the old
Know Nothing party? In the South, he knew, it would be
untactful, to say the least, to introduce a political party or
secret organization as one that Abraham Lincoln had
favored or that Jefferson Davis had repudiated. It wouldn’t
stand a ghost of a show. But the old Know Nothing party,
the object of which was practically the same as that of the
Trick Track Tribe had been repudiated by Lincoln and, of
course, by all abolitionists.</p>

<p>Parkins did <em>not</em> remember the pro-slavery flavor of the
old American party.</p>

<p>“I believe the party actually elected a few representatives
to Congress,” said Parkins, pursing his lips and coming as
near as he could to scowling in an effort to remember.
“Through the Tribe the American party might actually be
revived. Yes, it could. If the American party had only
triumphed fifty years ago we should not now have to face
the problem raised by the hordes of immigrants from eastern
and southern Europe.”</p>

<p>Robert remembered that the party was active not fifty, but
seventy years ago, and that at that time it was not southern
and eastern European immigrants who were being opposed,
but western Europeans. The aliens whom the Know Nothings
referred to as the scum of Europe and would have disenfranchised
were English, Germans and Irish.</p>

<p>“<span class="lock">Er—</span>a—yes,” agreed Robert. “It would have kept out
the undesirables.”</p>

<p>Parkins promised to use “what little influence he had in
spreading the doctrines of the Tribe” and they agreed to get
together and work out a constructive program for “putting
over” the Trick Track Tribe among the business men of
greater Chicago.</p>

<p>The colored porter came through the Pullman, announcing
the proximity of Chicago and began brushing off the
passengers at the farther end of the car. It was almost
noon. Robert looked out of the window. For a long <span class="lock">time—</span>hours
it <span class="lock">seemed—</span>they had been running through rows of
ugly factories and houses, rather grimy and bare, with only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
occasional patches of sooty grass to relieve the monotony.
They passed under stiff steel bridges and along bare walls,
beneath the level of the street. Then the ground very slowly
met the tracks. The stretches of <span class="lock">ground—</span>vacant lots, factory
sites, parks, were flat and gray. Dirty, yellow and
orange street cars jerked along the level streets. Not a hill
in sight. Interminable rows of stores, factories, habitations.
Increasing soot. A glimpse of great buildings beyond.
Then they passed under a huge dark shed. Robert wondered
whether McCall would meet him. He had written
Bill a week ago. He thought of Dorothy. He felt lonely,
oppressed by the massiveness of the dingy station and of
the city. Parkins was standing up. So were the other
passengers. The train came to a stop and Robert, in line,
slowly made his way to the door.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

</div>

<p>McCall was there, looking comfortably negligent in a light
Norfolk suit and gray cap, a cigarette drooping from the
corner of his mouth. It was <span class="lock">warm—</span>springlike for a person
coming from <span class="lock">Corinth—</span>but close and sticky. It was hard
to breathe, because of the soot, and bits of it kept getting
in his eye.</p>

<p>McCall recognized Robert and whooped for joy. He
swore picturesque oaths and called Hamilton vile names,
and Robert retorted in kind.</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr">Sacré bleu! Nom de cochin!</i>” McCall rattled off. How
was the tin rib? How was his state of health? How long
was he staying? Where was he staying? He asked questions
without waiting for answers and Robert answered them
by asking others.</p>

<p>“Oh, the eye is all right,” said McCall. “Perfect! Only
Doc says I must cut down on the number of eye openers.
Levin couldn’t make the train because he’s away on a case,
but he wants you to come over to his house Friday evening.
You’re not married yet?”</p>

<p>“Nope,” said Robert. “Do I look—”</p>

<p>“Sure you look crazy. Let me take another look at you.”
He held him away at arm’s length. “But not crazy enough.”</p>

<p>McCall offered to share his room, but Robert had already
reserved one at a hotel by wire. They reached the hotel by
taxi, after a short ride between tall, soot-stained buildings,
on streets thick and noisy with traffic. At almost every corner
the taxi was stopped by the cross flow of hurrying men
and women and vehicles. Then the shrill blast of the traffic
patrolman’s whistle and they poured forward again with the
current. There were glimpses of a huge steel skeleton
reaching to the sky and sounds of the riveters. At the end
of what appeared to be an alley loomed a massive gray
<span class="lock">building—</span>the post office. Elevated trains thundered overhead.
Surface cars rattled and clanged on the streets. The
sidewalks swarmed with hurrying people. It was a <span class="lock">race—</span>a
contest to get somewhere first. You had to shout to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
heard and then after shouting a few times you forgot what
you had started to say. The taxi kept stopping suddenly and
as suddenly shooting ahead.</p>

<p>“Well, what do you think of Chicago?” asked McCall,
when they were in their room and the bell boy had been dismissed
with a tip.</p>

<p>“Rotten!” said Hamilton. “I’ve got a cinder in my eye.”</p>

<p>“It’s a sign of progress,” said McCall. “Cinders. Smoke.
Tall chimneys. Railroads. Skyscrapers. Noise. Confusion.
A few murders for variety and lots of vice. I’ll show
you the stockyards. Then you will think Clark street is like
a bed of violets. What’s this thing? ‘Do You Know That?’—or
I’ll take you to our black and tan belt some night.”</p>

<p>Robert realized that, in throwing his coat on the bed, one
of the Trick Track Tribe cards had fallen out.</p>

<p>“Oh, never mind. It’s not important.”</p>

<p>But McCall had already picked it up and was reading it.</p>

<p>“Oh, here’s a lulu!” he exclaimed. “Here’s richness.
Here’s charity. That’s one of the Trick Track Tribe’s
little cardlets, if I mistake not. Where’d you get it? Let
me have it, I’m working on an expose of the Tribe. It’s a
nice mess. Say, you ought to be able to help me. The headquarters
is in Corinth.”</p>

<p>Robert turned red and pretended to search for something
in his coat pocket.</p>

<p>“<span class="lock">Why—</span>er—<span class="lock">a—</span>you know—” Robert coughed. “Well,
you know the Tribe is a sort of secret organization.”</p>

<p>McCall cocked his head on one side and scowled impressively.</p>

<p>“Aha,” he said. “Sherlock Holmes comes all the way
from Corinth to tell me that it’s a secret organization.”</p>

<p>“Well, a—”</p>

<p>McCall laughed.</p>

<p>“Don’t look so damn embarrassed. I suppose you don’t
know any more about it than I do about the current city hall
scandal. Just as you have the Tribe, we have our weekly
public scandal. Political factions calling each other crooks,
and all of ’em right. If a person kids me about our mayor,
I laugh with him. And if I were from Corinth and somebody<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
talked about the Trick Track Tribe I’d do the same
thing. I suppose it’s only the lower element, the lawless
whites responsible for your lynchings, that belongs.”</p>

<p>Robert made a vague noise in his throat, something halfway
between a cough and a gurgle, which McCall interpreted
as an affirmative reply.</p>

<p>“The Tribe has an office here, I’ve got the address.
They’re just planning their campaign now. When it breaks,
we’ll be ready to break, too. If you don’t mind, I’ll take this
card to Father Callahan. I want him to answer these questions.
Of course, you know and I know that they’re stupid
lies, but I want the proof. I want to be able to nail the lies. I’d
like to confront one of the head Tribesmen with the answers.”</p>

<p>“Do you belong to the Knights of Columbus?” asked
Robert.</p>

<p>“No, but I know these charges are crazy. It’s simply a
fraternal organization for Catholics.”</p>

<p>“Well, you can’t tell. Some of these statements are pretty
positive. Maybe it is in politics. Gee, I’m black.”</p>

<p>Robert stripped off his collar and shirt and began washing.
McCall’s protests against the accusations, various questions
about Robert’s health and bits of information came gurgling
through the soap and water. He talked about Levin. The
operation had made him one of the most talked of physicians
in Chicago and his profession. And he hadn’t charged a
cent. Before he started he insisted that it be done gratis,
but that in case he failed he should not be liable in any way.
Levin was very busy. He was on the staff of one of the
big hospitals and had hardly an evening to himself. He
would run up if he had chance, but insisted that Robert
come to his home for dinner Friday evening. Friday night
was a sort of holiday among the Jews, something like Sunday
among Christians, and it was considered especially
praiseworthy to feed a guest on this night. Levin’s father
still kept up the old custom.</p>

<p>“But won’t it be sort <span class="lock">of—</span>funny there?” asked Robert,
wiping his face. McCall had taken a position on the bed.
“Ah, the old bunk fatigue, I see.”</p>

<p>“Yes, the habit sticks. I usually lie down on the Press<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
Club lounges at noon. It’s such a change from lying in
your own bed.”</p>

<p>“Won’t the Levins have queer prayers and ceremonies?”</p>

<p>“Why, no. The old man is orthodox. That is, he isn’t
really orthodox, but he still keeps Friday night. You may
find him wearing a little skull cap and they may have a
candelabra burning on the <span class="lock">table—</span>I go there once in a while.”</p>

<p>“Well,” Robert hesitated, “Levin’s all right, but what sort
of people will I meet there? You know the Jew you usually
<span class="lock">meet—</span>little fellows with long beards and hats pulled over
their eyes, smelling of garlic and talking with their hands.”</p>

<p>He gave a ludicrous imitation.</p>

<p>“Jews you meet?” repeated McCall. “Where do you
meet ’em like that? Maybe they did that fifty years ago.
You probably saw Jews like that on the vaudeville stage.”</p>

<p>Robert considered and grinned.</p>

<p>“Well, maybe. It’s probably a little exaggerated, but
they do wear beards and—”</p>

<p>“Some do and some don’t. My dad used to wear chin
whiskers, but he didn’t look like the monkey-faced Irishmen
on the stage with inverted clay pipes between their
teeth. Doesn’t your father wear a beard? Oh, you’ll find
a peddler or two still clinging to the whiskers.”</p>

<p>“Well, but most of ’em are rather loud. I know even in
New York, at the cafés they seemed conspicuous.”</p>

<p>“By gravy, I’m going to suspect you of being a member
of the Trick Track Tribe,” laughed McCall. He seized a
pillow and amused himself by throwing it up and down.
“Well, the first time I went to Levin’s, I also had a feeling
that I’d meet only peddlers, pawnbrokers and clothing salesmen.
But that idea is like the idea that a man visiting an
Irishman’s house will find pigs in the parlor and meet only
hod-carriers, politicians and policemen. You wouldn’t associate
with a poor white, would you?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not.”</p>

<p>“Then why should Levin associate with a peddler? I
haven’t anything against a peddler especially, only I mean
that Jews have social classes just as anybody else has.
Jacob Schiff or Louis Brandeis wouldn’t associate with—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, shut up!” laughed Robert, throwing a towel at him.
“For Levin’s sake I’ll eat a pound of garlic. And, by the
way, I’d like to have you show me the answers that Father
Callahan gives to those questions; I’d just like to know.”</p>

<p>Robert had decided to write Griffith regarding certain
phases of the Tribe’s campaign which were not clear to him,
and if the Knights of Columbus were really not in politics,
he would inquire about that phase of the campaign also.</p>

<p>“Have you started your big novel yet?” asked Robert.</p>

<p>McCall paused in the midst of a series of abdominal exercises,
which consisted of alternately raising and lowering
his legs.</p>

<p>“No,” he said. “What gave you that idea?”</p>

<p>“Why you said that—”</p>

<p>“That’s no reason at all. I simply want to write it. I
probably never will. Every newspaper man is going to
write a novel or a play. Once in a while somebody does.
But he’s usually a rotten newspaper man. Sometimes a cub
is lucky enough to get fired. That saves his literary career.
If he weren’t fired he would degenerate into a good newspaper
man or even an editor. Young Fitzgerald couldn’t
hold a job, so he had plenty of time to write books. And
didn’t Upton Sinclair try to get a job on a newspaper once?
No, of course, you didn’t know. That was a rhetorical
question. If you had been able to answer, I’d say it was
just a plain, garden variety question.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you haven’t time enough to write, why don’t you
resign?” inquired Robert. “Here, get your feet off my coat.”</p>

<p>“All right, it hasn’t spoiled the polish much. But the
reason why I don’t resign is because if I did that, I would <em>have</em>
to write a novel. I don’t like to be forced to an alternative
voluntarily. This way I can simply say I haven’t the time.”</p>

<p>“Well, your words may mean something to you, but they
mean very, very little to me.”</p>

<p>“As it should be,” said McCall. “Where are we going
to eat? I’ll show you a good <span class="lock">place—</span>when I speak it is
rather to express myself than to convey thought. Speech
arose originally from the need to express certain unique
conceptions, ideas or fancies. In fact, it was a disadvantage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
that anybody else understood one, because that destroyed
the uniqueness of one’s idea. Just a minute. I wish
to work out the thought. You don’t have to listen if you
don’t wish to. If you have ever heard two persons arguing
you have undoubtedly noted that neither ever convinces the
other, that in fact they never listen to each other’s arguments.
That supports my contention. Each person simply talks
to express his own ideas, to get rid of them, to work them
out of his system. The <em>catharsis</em>, or something, of Plato.”</p>

<p>“Now I notice how much I’ve missed you,” said Robert.
“I’ve absolutely forgotten how to talk nonsense.”</p>

<p>“An art acquired only by arduous practice and by the
few,” said McCall. “Any damn fool can talk sense.”</p>

<p>He rose leisurely, ran his fingers through his hair and
threw his cap on his head. “I say, young fellow,” he suddenly
remarked. “Didn’t you say you were going to do
something as soon as you got back home, some little thing,
some trifle, like getting married?”</p>

<p>Robert acknowledged it.</p>

<p>“Broken romance? Or just plain broke?” asked McCall.</p>

<p>“Just plain broke,” laughed Robert. “I’ll tell you about
it at lunch.”</p>

<p>They ate at the Press Club, a few blocks away from the
hotel, a comfortable place on the top of an office building,
across the street from the City Hall.</p>

<p>“Once in a while you see a newspaper man here,” said
McCall gravely. “Usually you find them sleeping on the
couches. But most of these men are professional <span class="lock">men—</span>lawyers,
prominent officials, bankers, and so forth. That
old gentleman with the long hair is a poet. Does cowboy
verse. That thin, gray-haired fellow is a literary critic.
Runs a little magazine. What do you want? The ham and
eggs are very good.”</p>

<p>McCall described some of the parties that had been held
at the Press Club in the old days and particularly of the
night they had entertained the Milwaukee Press Club. The
visitors had been met at the “L” station by a reception committee
in weird costumes and paraded to the club in brewery<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
trucks, headed by a band. The program had been drawn
up with a view to shocking, if possible, the visitors, and beer,
whiskey and sandwiches had circulated freely. At the conclusion
women <span class="lock">from—</span>well, it didn’t matter where they were
<span class="lock">from—</span>had danced the dance of the seven veils, without the
veils. Some of the trustees had been shocked and the program
committee had been reprimanded and suspended.</p>

<p>“And now what were you going to tell me?”</p>

<p>Robert explained in a general way how the Hamilton
interests had met with reverses, and allowed McCall to infer
that he had come to Chicago on business connected with the
corporation. It saved explanations.</p>

<p>“Now, of course, I know that Margaret doesn’t want me
because of my money, but I haven’t had the courage to tell
her. Of course, she ought to know. What would you do?”</p>

<p>“I’d tell her, Ham. I’d tell her openly. Of course, you’re
sure you love her. That’s the main thing.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to marry her,” replied Robert. In his own
mind the answer suddenly flared like a light. “I am going
to marry her.” It was loyalty to her, loyalty to his promise,
loyalty to an idea, and perhaps to an old love. Was it anything
else? He suddenly remembered something.</p>

<p>“I’ve got something of yours,” he said, reaching into his
breast pocket. “I was going to send it to you, but I kept
forgetting or putting it off.” He pulled out an envelope, on
the back of which was scribbled a sonnet. McCall took it
and examined it in surprise.</p>

<p>“Why, that’s your envelope. Your name on it. Oh, now
I see. Where’d you get hold of that?”</p>

<p>He laughed.</p>

<p>“You didn’t need to bother about it. I copied it. Yes,
I remember I borrowed the envelope from you one day at
the hospital, when I was short of paper. ‘The aged pilgrim
hastens on the road.’ That’s the sonnet. I read it to Meadows,
she thought it was rather pretty and I gave it to her.”</p>

<p>Robert felt himself choking.</p>

<p>“<span class="lock">You—</span>you—didn’t write it <em>to</em> her. It wasn’t anything
more than, than—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span></p>

<p>“What are you staring at me for? You mean was I in
love with her?”</p>

<p>“Yes! Yes!”</p>

<p>McCall laughed.</p>

<p>“Why now, where’d you get that idea?”</p>

<p>“In New York, in that café, you recited it. You said
something about a girl you had met in France and whom
you’d never see again.”</p>

<p>“I was drinking, Ham, wasn’t I? And I’ve met several
girls in France, have I not? And why should I say I’d
never see Miss Meadows again? You know she lives in
Chicago. Especially if I loved her. You act as though you
were jealous. I simply said that because I was a trifle drunk
and because I thought it would give the poem a better
setting.”</p>

<p>Now it all seemed perfectly absurd. Of course, McCall
would see Dorothy again. They both lived in Chicago.
<span class="lock">And—</span>well, it was simply inexplainable. For the first time
he realized how much he had been thinking of Dorothy.
How often some incident associated with their brief
acquaintance had flashed through his mind, only to be suppressed.
On the way to Chicago, he had kept thinking of
her, had seen her image in the clouds and in the trees.
Everywhere Dorothy. Dorothy. Dorothy. But then—</p>

<p>“I suppose you don’t know—” McCall began when the
clerk at the desk began calling his name. The colored waiter
hurried up.</p>

<p>“I guess it’s de Times wants you,” he said.</p>

<p>McCall excused himself and hurried to the phone. Robert
stared at the plate.</p>

<p>“Anything else, sir?” asked the waiter.</p>

<p>McCall rushed back.</p>

<p>“Off on a big story!” he cried. “May be gone a few days.
I’ll call you when I come back. Take your time about finishing.
It’s charged to my account.”</p>

<p>He signed his name to the slip.</p>

<p>“Well, so long, Ham. Sorry, but business is business.”</p>

<p>He shook hands and hurried out of the room.</p>

</div>

<p>It was surprising how merely meeting McCall once more
should so strongly revive old memories clustering about
Dorothy. There was his first memory of her at the <span class="lock">hospital—</span>her
cool hand on his forehead; her quick, skillful
movements; her sympathetic smile. There was Dorothy at
the Luxembourg Gardens, holding his hand and looking
gently down at the ground. There was the <span class="lock">kiss—</span>like a scarlet
memory. There were a hundred little gestures, glances
of her eyes, movements of her hands, the way she patted
back a stray wisp of <span class="lock">hair—</span>a hundred nothings. All these
came back to him now.</p>

<p>After leaving the Press Club, he had been unable to reach
Levin by <span class="lock">phone—</span>he was still busy on his <span class="lock">case—</span>and so he
had walked eastward to Michigan Avenue and then along
the row of shops, stopping to peer into windows, viewing
the stream of fashionably attired men and women and the
swiftly passing motor cars and taxis. A sooty, green park
ran along the lake front and a gray stone building of classic
design commanded it. Beyond the park Lake Michigan
looked green and cool and clean. As he walked, Robert kept
fancying that he saw Dorothy just ahead of him, but whenever
he quicked his pace he would find it simply an <span class="lock">illusion—</span>a
passing resemblance.</p>

<p>He turned west to La Salle <span class="lock">Street—</span>two rows of gigantic structures—
banks, trust companies, brokerages <span class="lock">mainly—</span>overshadowing a current
of business men, their bankers, lawyers and clerks, and of hurrying
vehicles. To the south, at the end of the street, he recognized the
Board of Trade Building.</p>

<p>Clinton Freeman, the man in charge of the Dearborn
Statistical Bureau, proved a hair taller than Robert, blond
and built like a <span class="lock">tackle—</span>a chap one could easily like. He
had come out of the war a first lieutenant, had been stationed
with Southern troops for several months and had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
grown to admire Southerners in a general way, without
analysing his reasons for it. He liked their soft accent and
liked to mimic it, throwing in an inordinate number of
“you-alls” and drawling out his words at exaggerated
length. He liked their geniality and their easy air of self-confidence.
He had found them generous, <span class="lock">courteous—</span>even
chivalrous, when they referred to <span class="lock">women—</span>and light-<span class="lock">hearted—</span>the
virtues of aristocracy. From these acquaintances
Freeman had learned the Southerner’s viewpoint on
<span class="lock">lynching—</span>the need of keeping the inferior black man in
his place, the necessity of stamping out “the only crime
for which a nigger is ever lynched.”</p>

<p>“I’m mighty glad to see you!” Freeman had an effusive
manner and gripped hands like a wrestler. “They wrote
you were coming and sent several wires. Come right in!”</p>

<p>Robert followed into a private office and, on a comfortable
swivel chair, swapped war and football experiences.
Yes, Freeman had played football, on a small mid-Western
college team, and remembered reading of Hamilton’s
exploits at Harvard.</p>

<p>“I’ll bet you could have raised hob with the Yale line,”
Robert appraised him frankly. “I think your Western
teams are on a par with the East’s best. Too bad they
don’t meet oftener.”</p>

<p>Freeman agreed as to the strength of the Western teams.</p>

<p>“Now,” he asked, a bit flattered, “what’s your plan of
work? Do you smoke?” He opened a drawer in his desk
and pulled out a box of cigars.</p>

<p>“Thanks!” Robert selected one. “<span class="lock">Well—</span>my plan is a
little vague.”</p>

<p>Freeman nodded sympathetically and offered him a light.
Robert puffed meditatively for a moment.</p>

<p>“Of course, I’m supposed to map out a definite campaign.
I understand you have been gathering data, getting up lists
and so on, you know—” he waved his hand—“as a sort
of basis for me to work on. Divide the city into districts,
get Bogeys to work each one, then go to another city and
so on. But—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, we’ve got quite a lot of dope here! Pardon me,
what were you going to say?”</p>

<p>“There are some things about the Tribe I wanted to ask
you about. You know I’ve just been taken in.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m pretty green myself. Only a month or so.”</p>

<p>Robert explained some of his perplexities, the questions
over which he had puzzled on the train.</p>

<p>“Oh, I wouldn’t bother too much about that,” said Freeman.
“The main object is to get members, find out what
they’re interested in and sell them from that angle. That
states’ rights stuff doesn’t mean anything. I wouldn’t mention
it at all. It might go well in the South, but not here,
except, perhaps, to some Democrats, only the trouble is that
most of them are Catholics.”</p>

<p>“But why is it on our cards?”</p>

<p>Freeman grinned.</p>

<p>“Well, somebody thought it was a good thing. Personally,
I don’t. But somebody had to decide. Of course,
it depends on how far you carry states’ rights. Take federal
meat inspection or the pure food act or the federal
income <span class="lock">tax—</span>those were all opposed because they interfered
with states’ rights. And I suppose the Southern mill owners
naturally oppose a federal child-labor law. But that’s
nothing to get memberships on. You’re probably right.
I suppose it was simply taken over from the old Know
Knothing party platform, when states’ rights meant no
interference with slavery. So I’d just forget it. Nobody
notices it on the card and thinks it means some sort of
guarantee of personal liberty like freedom of speech and
freedom of the press, which the Constitution guarantees
us anyway.”</p>

<p>Robert almost admired, without in any way approving,
Freeman’s easy manner of using or discarding an argument
according to his belief in its power to convince. If an
argument didn’t convince he simply dropped it, and he
never apologized for having used a false or fallacious one.
He had a bass voice, which he could let out on occasion,
especially when he spoke on the Tribal ideal of patriotism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span></p>

<p>“The Trick Track Tribe is not merely a political party
to secure this or that law or set of laws, Hamilton. It is
a militant group, formed to combat all the forces that are
attacking Americanism.” He brought his fist down on the
desk with a bang. “States’ rights may or may not be of
particular importance. National prohibition may or may
not meet favor with all true Americans, but there can be
no question about the supremacy of the white race, the
rights guaranteed us by the American Constitution, separation
of church and state, the sanctity of the home.” The
last phrase fairly rolled out of Freeman’s eloquent mouth.
“It is our aim to guard the supremacy of the white race,
protect our Constitution from the radicals who would attack
it and keep the hand of the Pope from clutching at
our state. In every way we shall work to conserve this
country and to confound the enemies within its walls as
well as without its gates, to support the government in enforcing
its laws and to aid the government whenever and
wherever it seems inadequate to cope with its foes. By
God, we’ll have law and order if we have to terrorize every
other man, woman and child in this country, and if we have
to tar and feather every person who doesn’t toe the mark!”</p>

<p>Freeman was a man who might easily sway an audience.
It was not so much what he said, but how he said it. Even
Robert felt himself carried away. There was something
about him when he became excited over his theme that
reminded one of Griffith. Both, then, had a natural eloquence.
And both, when they fell back into the discussion
of more commonplace subjects, appeared to <span class="lock">relax—</span>Griffith
into a bored carelessness, Freeman into a broad friendliness.</p>

<p>“Before you start working, you ought to look around the
city a bit.” Freeman looked at his watch. “I’ll be busy for
another hour or so, or perhaps we’d better start out some
morning. I suppose you’re a stranger here.”</p>

<p>“Practically,” said Robert. “But I think I’d rather wait
until some other time. It’s too late now.” He made some
remark about having a lot of “things” to attend <span class="lock">to—</span>a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
nebulous idea thrown out so that he might be alone that
evening.</p>

<p>A stenographer opened the door and tossed a publication
on the desk. Freeman glanced at it.</p>

<p>“Before you go,” he said, “take this along. Never seen
a colored paper before, have you?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Well, just read it. Some colored fanatics want social
equality with the whites, repeal of all laws prohibiting intermarriage
of blacks and whites and junk like that.”</p>

<p>“Well, if we had them down in Corinth we’d know how
to fix ’em.”</p>

<p>“I’ll say you would!”</p>

<p>They shook hands warmly.</p>

<p>“You probably want to be alone tonight, but any time
you’re <span class="lock">lonely—</span>you know, just give me a ring.”</p>

<p>“All right.”</p>

<p>Robert stuck the paper in his pocket and left.</p>

<p>He got another cinder in his eye returning to the hotel,
and found his room lonesome and noisy. Two blocks away
a skyscraper was being erected and the continual rat-a-tat
of the riveters, like the bullets of machine guns, mingled with
the repeated blasts of patrolmen’s whistles, the noise of
hundreds of vehicles and of thousands of human beings.
His nostrils were filled with fine particles of coal and dust.
Robert was lonesome and wondered why he had refused
Freeman’s invitation. Of course, there were letters to write
and booklets to read, but then it was only a little after four
and he would have all evening for that.</p>

<p>Because it was the thing he least wished to do, he decided
to write Margaret first of all. His fountain pen was dry
and the ink well in the combination table and desk held only
some black powder and a dead fly. He telephoned to the
desk and while waiting for the ink idly looked through the
telephone directory. The advertisements. The Hamiltons.
The M’s. He was conscious that his heart was beating
unusually fast. But there were so many Meadows that it
was impossible even to guess which might be the right<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
one. He telephoned to Levin’s home again, leaving his
name and telephone number.</p>

<p>As he did so, he had a peculiar feeling of slipping back
in time a half <span class="lock">year—</span>their last meeting in New York, the
sense of their friendship. He wondered whether belonging
to the Tribe would put an end to that.</p>

<p>A perspiring bell boy brought the ink, took the tip thankfully
and made some remark about the weather. The door
closed behind him and Robert began writing. It was dreadful
business telling her about the family financial troubles.
Why should he do it? Well, it had to be done somehow.
He wondered why it should be <span class="lock">Margaret—</span>how they had
really become engaged.</p>

<p>Levin surprised him by telephoning from the lobby, just
as he was dashing off the last line. He hastily addressed
the envelope, folded the letter, slipped it inside and grabbed
his hat. He looked guiltily at a little pile of Tribal propaganda
and placed it in the dresser drawer out of sight. The
Tribe was, somehow, against the Jews. He hadn’t found
out why yet, but it seemed more decent to have the booklets
out of sight.</p>

<p>Levin was pacing the lobby, the same old Levin, only a
bit overworked perhaps, nervous. But it was good to see
him again. Levin’s face lit up.</p>

<p>“It’s like being in Paris again,” he remarked. “Welcome
to Chicago!” He would have had Robert up to the house,
but something made that impossible. His sister was having
a little society <span class="lock">meeting—</span>or something like that.</p>

<p>“It’s great to see you again, Doc,” said Hamilton.</p>

<p>“You have come just in time. I needed someone to talk
to.” Levin knew a restaurant, De Jonghe’s, and whisked
him to it. It <em>was</em> somewhat Gallic, not exactly a French
restaurant, but as French as one might reasonably expect
five thousand miles west of Paris. And the food was delicious.
They lingered over it.</p>

<p>“You look—” Robert paused. “Have you just fallen
into love or out?”</p>

<p>Levin laughed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span></p>

<p>“Well, perhaps, <em>out</em>. Not exactly, though.” He changed
the subject. “What’s that?” He had noticed the paper in
Robert’s pocket.</p>

<p>“Oh, let me see. Oh, yes, some nigger paper.” He laid
it on the table.</p>

<p>“Ah, The Torch.” Levin picked it up and began turning
the pages. “It’s one of the leading colored papers in the
country now. <span class="lock">And—</span>by <span class="lock">George—</span>guess who’s running it!”</p>

<p>“How the dickens should I know who’s running a nigger
paper? Got a cigarette on you?”</p>

<p>“Never mind, I’ll order cigars. Sure, you know him.
The fellow who saved your life in France.”</p>

<p>“The nigger! Williams?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Williams. He’s considered one of the highest literary
authorities in the United States. You ought to see
him while you’re here.”</p>

<p>“I would,” said Robert. “I would, if he weren’t a nigger.”</p>

<p>“Oh, rats, I thought you had gotten over that!”</p>

<p>A waiter appeared, set a bottle of wine and glasses on
the table and offered a box of cigars. Robert took one,
laid it on the table and sipped thoughtfully at his wine. Had
he changed? And had he changed back again? A nigger
was a nigger to him once more. But in Corinth, yes, even
in Corinth, he had put in a word for the despised black.
Once he had thought that the ideals born of the war, the
spirit of democracy and justice and idealism, would last.
Here it <span class="lock">was—</span>how many months? two months, not quite
three, since his <span class="lock">homecoming—</span>and he was back again. Or
was it simply the pressure of <span class="lock">Corinth—</span>Margaret, Pinkney,
his father, his set. Catholic. Jew. The Trick Track Tribe.
Well, one had to live in his own world. And anyway a
nigger was black and ugly and overworked.</p>

<p>“But I really couldn’t go to him. Bah! Shake his hand?
No thanks!”</p>

<p>“The reaction <em>has</em> set in,” remarked Levin. “And you’re
an example.” He lit a cigar and puffed for a moment.
“Now it’s the nigger. Next it will <span class="lock">be—</span>why where you come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
from, Corinth, you’ve got your Trick Track <span class="lock">Tribe—</span>an
organization with the identical aims of the secret societies
of savages and based on nothing but prejudices.”</p>

<p>“But you must admit that the nigger is different,” protested
Robert. “He has always been the accursed of races.
He has always been a slave. He has never had a civilization,
never had a government, never created anything. Africa!
What would it be if it weren’t for the whites? Hell, these
coons who wait on the tables and shine shoes would still be
savages in the jungles, without education and without religion,
if it weren’t for the white man.”</p>

<p>“I’ll admit nothing,” Levin retorted. “You speak from
prejudice. Take Williams for instance. He’s educated,
cultured, refined. He <em>does</em> hold a high position in the literary
world and among his own race. Don’t sneer! But you
wouldn’t visit him simply because he’s black.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll admit that Williams is all that you say. He’s
an exception. I’ll admit that there are a thousand such
exceptions in the world. What of it? What has that to do
with what I have said? I said that the nigger has always
been a slave, that he has always—”</p>

<p>Levin interrupted.</p>

<p>“You have an idea that the Negro is somehow sub-human?”</p>

<p>“<span class="lock">Well—</span>yes, if you put it that way!”</p>

<p>“That’s a belief that is based neither on science nor on
history. It is flatly contradicted by Egyptian, Greek, Roman,
Byzantine and Arabian experience, and it is being contradicted
in this country today. Whether Negroes are equal
in capacity to white <span class="lock">men—</span>that is on the <span class="lock">average—</span>or even
whether they have produced or will produce a single genius
worthy to rank with the highest geniuses of the white race
is an idle and unimportant question. They can at least gain
their livelihood as laborers and artisans. They can operate
their own farms. They can take their place in the mines
and the forests. Let them have fair play and they will
naturally find their right place, wherever that may be. The
Tribe talks of Negro disloyalty, of seditious plots with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
Bolsheviki. There is not a shred of evidence to back these
extravagant charges against an entire race. But if the white
men treated them with fairness and justice they would have
no reason to fear even these mythical plots. Experience has
shown that whenever aliens are treated as citizens, they become
citizens, whatever may be their religion or race. Give
the American Negro but half a chance and you will find that
he loves and hates, not with an African, but with an American
heart.</p>

<p>“You say that the Negro has never had a civilization. He
has had one of the most ancient of civilizations, with centers
of culture at Ghana, Melle and Timbuctoo. There were
kingdoms and empires in Songhay and Zymbabwe. There
were art and industry in Yuruba and Benien, Negroes
worked in iron long before the European. They wove.
They carved. They had their music. They had a well-organized
tribal government, with town meetings and market
places. Those are the elements of <span class="lock">civilization—</span>not our
<span class="lock">civilization—</span>not the civilization of the cold North or East,
of Europe or <span class="lock">Asia—</span>but a highly developed civilization
adapted to Africa. Out of Africa came the ivory and gold
of the remotest times. <span class="lock">Africans—</span>your <span class="lock">niggers—</span>welded
iron, practiced agriculture and carried on trade when Europe
was still a wilderness. Your niggers sat on the throne
of the Pharaohs in Egypt.”</p>

<p>“Niggers the kings of Egypt! Why how—?”</p>

<p>“The next time you see a picture of the great sphinx of
Ghizeh, study its features. Thick lips. Flat nose. High
cheek bones. The features are those of a Negro. And the
Pharaohs did not erect sphinxes in honor of their slaves!
Yes, Negroes, during certain dynasties, ruled Egypt, the
most ancient of civilizations, the birthplace of learning. And
it was a black woman, Queen Nefertari, who is the most
venerated figure in Egyptian history.”</p>

<p>“I never knew that.” Robert puffed thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“And what did the white man do for Africa? For four
hundred years, white Europe traded in black human beings,
robbed Africa of a hundred million human souls, transformed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
the face of her social life, overthrew her organized
government, distorted her ancient industry and snuffed out
her cultural development. Today, instead of taking slaves
from Africa, white men are converting Africa into a huge
plantation, where the natives toil and die under the lash for
the profit of the white world. Yes, the white men brought
<span class="lock">religion—</span>the Bible in one hand and the rifle in the other.
And, oh, yes, they brought another <span class="lock">thing—</span>gin.</p>

<p>“Listen to this. It’s from a colored writer, Du Bois:
‘Twenty centuries after Christ, Black <span class="lock">Africa—</span>prostrated,
raped and <span class="lock">shamed—</span>lies at the foot of the conquering Philistines
of Europe. Beyond the awful sea, a black woman is
weeping and waiting, with her sons on her breast. What
shall the end be? The world-old and fearful <span class="lock">things—</span>war
and wealth, murder and luxury? Or shall it be a new <span class="lock">thing—</span>a
new peace and a new democracy of all <span class="lock">races—</span>a great
humanity of equal men?’”</p>

<p>Robert laid down his cigar.</p>

<p>“I guess, we have been a little rough on them,” he said.</p>

<p>Levin developed the idea of the reaction, the growth of
hatreds, the development of the mob spirit.</p>

<p>“You can’t get any two men to think exactly alike on any
question,” he said. “But, with a little knowledge of human
nature and the gift of oratory or a forceful way of writing,
you can get millions to <em>feel</em> <span class="lock">alike—</span>especially to hate alike.
The crowd just now is stirred up against alcohol. In Rome
the crowd used to be stirred up for it and went on Bacchanals.”</p>

<p>“But alcohol does detract from one’s efficiency, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Certainly! But who drinks to become more efficient?
You drink to become less efficient, to forget your troubles,
to relax, to forget. Granted that alcohol makes a man unable
to turn a grindstone as rapidly as water. His ultimate object
in turning the grindstone is to be able to buy pleasure,
which includes alcohol. Take away his pleasure and you
take away his object for working.”</p>

<p>“Well, I hate to see prohibition come. But I guess most
of the people want it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, that is the intolerance of your mob. The tyranny of
the majority. If fifty-one per cent of the people don’t want
to drink, or don’t want to smoke, or don’t want to sing songs
on Sunday, they make everybody else conform. The mob
uses its liberty to deprive the individual of his freedom.”</p>

<p>For the first time Robert felt ill at ease in Levin’s company.
The knowledge that Levin was a Jew and that he
himself was a member of the Trick Track Tribe made him
feel uneasy, as though he were a traitor, but whether to his
old friendship or to the Tribe he was uncertain. They sat
talking for a while, exchanging reminiscences of Paris and
New York, and Levin finally walked with Robert back to
his hotel.</p>

<p>“Be sure to come up Friday,” said Levin.</p>

<p>Robert promised, yet he knew that he would not keep the
appointment. It was bad enough going out with him, but
he had been unable to avoid that. But to break bread with
him in his own house, to accept his hospitality and that of
his family, that would be going too far. Not while he
remained a member of the Tribe.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XXXII"><abbr title="Thirty-two">XXXII</abbr></h2>
</div>

<p>Robert called up <span class="lock">Friday—</span>Mrs. Levin answered the <span class="lock">phone—</span>and
pleaded a mythical headache. No. No. Her son was
not to visit him. It was nothing. Something that would
go away of its own accord. Only he would have to eat
very little and get a good rest. Mrs. Levin offered some
<span class="lock">advice—</span>aspirin tablets, or something like that. It was
rather confusing, her insistent hospitality, and she rang off
only after she had gained his promise to come the next week.</p>

<p>Robert was growing a bit more accustomed to Chicago.
Freeman had taken him, over his protest, to Armours, where
he had seen the rather gruesome spectacle of hundreds of
hogs and cattle converted into pork and beef by swift knives
and dexterous hands. He had never dreamed of this world
of cattle pens, stretching out in all directions like a vast sea
and filled with thousands of bellowing animals. He had
never imagined such a tangle of tracks as those over which
the loaded cattle cars rumbled. And there were cowboys
on ponies.</p>

<p>He was becoming accustomed to the rush of people among
the streets and to the noise. But the soot still bothered him.
He had visited the Art Institute and found it a haven from
the surrounding spirit of commercialism and decided to visit
the Field <span class="lock">Museum—</span>a glittering white palace of classical
design that rose at the far end of a promontory jutting into
the lake a mile or so south.</p>

<p>In some places there were almost as many Negroes as in
the South. But unlike the South, the Negroes sat beside you
in the presence of white <span class="lock">ladies—</span>like the white men. For the
first time Robert perceived that in going back to Corinth he
had unconsciously slipped back to his pre-war attitude. He
had taken Jim Crow cars for granted. He had taken it for
granted that colored men should step out of his path when
he walked down the street. These things had all seemed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
perfectly natural in Corinth. He had not even noticed them
until now.</p>

<p>Levin had dropped in once, to inquire about Robert’s
cold, but had not called again. McCall was still out of town,
and so Robert spent most of his time with Freeman. The
latter had suggested that Robert do most of his work in his
own room, because the identity of the bureau with the Tribe
had already been discovered by <span class="lock">investigators—</span>newspaper
<span class="lock">men—</span>and it might be more advantageous, at least for a
while, to keep the identity of the new Grand Bogey secret.</p>

<p>Freeman had not yet explained the basis of the Tribe’s
antagonism to the Catholics and the Jews, nor, so far as
that went, to the <span class="lock">Negro—</span>although that was something that
one could more easily understand. Freeman always brought
up points, which he gleaned from The Beacon or from some
similar source and the authenticity of which was often
doubtful. Often the statements contradicted each other
and then Freeman always grinned good-naturedly and
showed that the arguments were really not his, but those
of The Beacon or of a misinformed writer, some anti- this
or that fanatic.</p>

<p>He always started out by emphasising the “big points” of
the Tribe. They were sitting in Robert’s room one evening.</p>

<p>“If I were you I’d go after the big <span class="lock">things—</span>enforcement
of law, white supremacy, pure Americanism and practical
Christianity. Those are the main things,” said Freeman,
pounding the table.</p>

<p>“You ask why the Catholic should be excluded? Because,
as this card shows, he swears allegiance to a foreign
potentate. He’s an alien although he benefits by our laws.
If the Catholics could, they would unite the church and the
state.”</p>

<p>“I see, but supposing I get a prospect and he asks me how
I know that.”</p>

<p>Freeman laughed.</p>

<p>“Ninety-nine out of a hundred don’t ask. Ninety-nine
out of a hundred men never ask about anything. They’ll
accept a positive statement, if it’s positive enough. But if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
they do ask, you can hand them some of our cards or literature.
Here’s some good stuff in The Beacon. Listen to
this, for instance: ‘The National Democratic Committee is
by majority a Roman Catholic body. It usually has a
Roman Catholic President and Secretary. Catholics influenced
the national campaign which elected Wilson. The
President’s private secretary is a Roman Catholic.’”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute,” cried Hamilton. “I’m a Southern
Democrat. Do you mean to insinuate that Wilson is controlled
by a group of Catholics!”</p>

<p>“I’m not insinuating anything. I’m simply reading what
The Beacon says. If a Democrat would get sore at it, show
him something else. That’s why I say you have to study
the man you approach and convince him accordingly.”</p>

<p>“But that’s not the point,” said Hamilton. “You say
Catholics influenced the national campaign. That’s an insinuation.
You don’t say <em>how</em> they influenced it. Everybody
knows that many Irish Catholics are Democrats and
that naturally they voted for Wilson, just as the South
naturally, for historic reasons, always votes Democratic;
but you infer that the influence was dishonorable. And
what’s the disgrace about a Roman Catholic being the President’s
secretary? He had to be a Protestant or a Catholic.”</p>

<p>“No, there’s no disgrace, only the next fact shows that
over 70 per cent of all President Wilson’s appointments
were Catholic.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe it! What’s the authority?”</p>

<p>Freeman puzzled over the word.</p>

<p>“L-U-T-<span class="lock">H—</span>Lutherische, I can’t pronounce it. Some
German name.”</p>

<p>“Some old war propaganda, I see. On the face of it
would you go to a German authority for anything about
Wilson’s war administration?”</p>

<p>Freeman laughed.</p>

<p>“Hell, no! In fact, I didn’t know where The Beacon got
this stuff when I picked it up or I wouldn’t bother to read it.
Nope, there’s nothing pro-Heinie about me.” He threw the
paper into a waste basket. “Now, Mr. Hamilton,” he turned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
in his swivel chair and leaned forward, “I’m just as sincere
about this thing as you are. I wouldn’t tell any one a lie
knowingly. If I had noticed the source of that article I
wouldn’t have read it to you. But the Tribe has a definite
object as I told you. It’s against the Catholic, the Jew, the
alien and the Negro, because these four classes are incompatible
with the Tribe’s ideas of pure <span class="lock">Americanism—</span>none of
these classes can be truly American in every sense of the
word. Now we know that, and, in trying to convert members,
we naturally wish to convince them by arguments. The
Beacon is a magazine which carries a lot of stuff against
these four classes and so we frequently distribute it. But,
as far as I am concerned, and I am sure as every good
Tribesman is concerned, we do not mean to disseminate
falsehoods. If you see an article that strikes you as inaccurate
in The Beacon, don’t use it. In fact, write to the editor
about it. I’m sure he would be glad to be corrected. You
know how it is. Any one is liable to make a mistake.”</p>

<p>“Well, maybe, but just a minute.” Hamilton pulled The
Beacon out of the waste-basket and glanced over it.</p>

<p>“Well, here we say that the German-Jewish bankers
started the war.”</p>

<p>“Sure, what about it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know if it’s true or not, but on our Do You Know
card we say that a secret treaty made by the Pope started
the war. Now one of those statements must be wrong. One
must be a lie.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Freeman. “Don’t you see, that Do You Know
card is gotten out by the Tribe? That’s something <em>we</em> say.
That article on the German-Jewish bankers starting the war
is simply a re-write of a statement made by Howard Brooks.
The Beacon simply picked it up. They’re not responsible
for Brooks’ views and the Tribe isn’t responsible for everything
The Beacon prints.”</p>

<p>Robert was growing exasperated, but he tried to keep his
temper. He puffed at his cigar in silence for a moment.</p>

<p>“Well, what do <em>you</em> think of that charge by Brooks yourself?”
he finally asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span></p>

<p>Freeman smiled.</p>

<p>“He makes good tires. But, seriously, I’ll tell you. Of
course, that sort of stuff is all right for the yokels. I studied
money and banking at college. I’m not a financial authority
or anything like that, but I know, of course, that the present
economic world could not exist without banks and credit.
We deposit our dues in a bank, and I suppose that Griffith
must be financing the Tribe through some bank, although,”
he grinned, “very probably not Kuhn, Loeb and Company.”
He threw his head back and blew a smoke ring into the air.</p>

<p>“Brooks simply says something to the effect that the big
international bankers saw an opportunity to make money
by fomenting a war, and stirred things up. Of course, if
Germany could win, any banker who lent the German government
a large sum would naturally make a large profit.
As a matter of fact, though, I think Germany had some
scheme of labor banks, in which the working people themselves
deposited.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Hamilton. “I think the Germans even used
to brag about the people financing their own war.”</p>

<p>“Of course, there’s no proof that any certain banker did
stir up the war. If there were, I don’t think that the allies
would have been bashful about demanding his surrender. If
any German-Jewish or German anything else clique of bankers
had been the cause of the war, they would have been
handed over to some tribunal, because the Versailles treaty
insists on punishment for those guilty of starting the war.
So that’s probably hot air. Of course, bankers backing their
country after it is in the war, is a different matter. It would
be first a matter of loyalty and second of compulsion. The
German-Jewish bankers would naturally support the German
government; but that’s a different thing from starting
a war, just as the French-Jewish bankers supported the
French government, the English, the English and the American,
the American. And you could say the same thing
about Protestant bankers.”</p>

<p>He puffed a few more rings into the air.</p>

<p>“Ah, I’ve got it. Stinnes. Stinnes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span></p>

<p>“What’s that?”</p>

<p>“Stinnes, the great banker, the friend of the Kaiser, president
of steamship lines, owner of iron and steel monopolies,
mills, <span class="lock">factories—</span>the great magnet of Germany. The war
made him a colossus, a rival of Rockefeller in wealth. And
he’s a Jew!”</p>

<p>“No, he’s not,” said Robert.</p>

<p>“Of course, he is. Haven’t you ever seen his <span class="lock">picture—</span>derby
hat pulled over his forehead. Sort of long nose and
black beard? Why he’s a typical Jew.”</p>

<p>“But he’s a Lutheran,” protested Robert. “I don’t care
how he looks. You got that impression that he was Jewish
because the first stories about him said he was. But in the
latest stories that was corrected. He’s a Lutheran.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure?” Freeman looked crestfallen.</p>

<p>“Absolutely. I can show you the magazine article.”</p>

<p>“No, I believe you. There goes another good point.”</p>

<p>Robert’s eyes suddenly blazed. It was as though something
had flared in his brain. And it angered him. It carried
him back to his solitary attempt at debating.</p>

<p>“You say you are sincere in carrying out the mission of
the Trick Track Tribe,” he cried. “Don’t interrupt me!
Yet you sit there like a lawyer trying to frame up a case
against an opponent, or a kid debater. Anything to win. If
you have anything against the Jews or the Catholics, I want
to see it. I don’t care a pig’s ear for any arguments about
what the Jews or the Catholics might do or might have done.
I can make up that sort of stuff myself. The Jews have a
plot to assassinate the President. The Catholics are planning
a world-wide revolution.”</p>

<p>Freeman was equally angry.</p>

<p>“Stop! We don’t make such wild assertions.”</p>

<p>“You do,” cried Hamilton. “I’ve simply reversed the
charges. Here’s your statement that ‘the man who shot
President Garfield was a Roman Catholic. The man who
shot President Lincoln was a Roman Catholic.’ And in another
article you say, or somebody says, that the Jews are
planning to spread Bolshevism throughout the world. When<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
you say that Roman Catholics killed two presidents, you
mean to insinuate that there is something about Catholicism
itself that makes it hostile to American government, that
makes it possible that another Roman Catholic will later kill
another president. If the relation were merely accidental
you wouldn’t mention it. It wouldn’t be logical. You might
as well say that the man who shot McKinley ate onions.”</p>

<p>His voice fell and he leaned forward in his chair confidentially.
“This is the thing that brought it home to me,”
he continued. “You were basing an accusation against the
Jews as a people because Stinnes, the Kaiser’s backer, was
supposedly a Jew. Now that it turns out that he’s a
Lutheran, you don’t propose an attack upon Lutherans for
causing the war, do you? Before, you didn’t honestly know
that Stinnes had the slightest connection with the cause of
the war. But because you thought he was a Jew, you would
have tricked me into assuming it, so as to make a point.”</p>

<p>“You’re right,” Freeman agreed finally. “The Tribe can’t
afford to use unfair arguments. It stands for justice first of
all. It stands for pure Americanism. But, first, in order
to have it, we must have pure Americans. You can’t have it
with Catholics, Jews, Negroes and aliens. They don’t
belong. They have alien beliefs, customs, traditions. We
can fight them fairly.</p>

<p>“I cannot help being what I am, racially. I am not a Jew,
nor a Catholic, nor a Negro, nor a foreigner. I am an
Anglo-Saxon white man, so ordained by God and so constituted
and trained that I cannot conscientiously take either
my politics or my religion from some secluded ass on the
other side of the world.</p>

<p>“Now, if somebody else happens to be a Jew, I can’t help
it any more than he can. Or if he happens to be black I
can’t help that either. If he were born under a foreign flag,
I couldn’t help <span class="lock">it—</span>but there is one thing I can do. I can
object to his un-American propaganda being preached in my
home or practised in the solemn assembly of real Americans!”</p>

<p>His voice was eloquent with emotion.</p>

<p>“I have fought for the American flag and, if God so
wishes, I am glad to die for it. But that flag must float over
a land untainted by any alienism. You ask me how I know
that Roman Catholics cannot be good Americans and I ask
you to read the oath of the Knights of Columbus. It requires
no further argument. It speaks for itself. You ask
me why Jews cannot become good Americans and I answer
because they are aliens by race, by religion and by tradition.”
His voice dropped.</p>

<p>“As for the colored problem: you know more about it
than I do. You’ve grown up with it. But some day I want
to show you what Chicago is up against. I want to take you
through the colored belt so that you can get some idea of
how the blacks are pouring into Chicago.”</p>

<p>He went into details. The blacks were becoming self-assertive.
They were walking proudly along the streets.
They were demanding social equality in their publications.
They were moving outside the black belt into white neighborhoods
and spoiling property values. They were sitting
next to white <span class="lock">men—</span>and even white women!—in the surface
and elevated cars. They were developing professional men
and business men, riding around in automobiles, smoking
cigars. But worst of all, they were competing against white
men for jobs.</p>

<p>“You see what’s happening in Washington? The same
thing will happen in Chicago!”</p>

</div>

<p>There was a stir in the sultry July air of the metropolis
of inland America. During the World War thousands of
blacks had been imported to fill the depleted ranks of white
men in the reeking stockyards, the sweltering foundries, the
clamourous shops. With their families they had swarmed
into the homes of the abandoned Red Light district to the
number of 125,000 and were even crowding, here and there,
beyond their boundaries into the sacred precincts of the
whites.</p>

<p>White working men, banded into labor unions, had
frowned upon their coming, but the industrial and political
barons had willed it. These latter had given them work at
almost white men’s pay, welded them into a political unit
and permitted them to elect black representatives to sit
among the city fathers. They had been lulled into the illusion
that here, at last, they were free from the howling mob,
the stake and torch, the hatred of the South.</p>

<p>They no longer bowed their heads as they walked along
the streets. They could almost look a white man in the eye.
They sat beside the whites on the street cars and in the
“L’s,” talked to them, ate beside them at some restaurants
and even, in certain dance halls, danced with their daughters.
A few had intermarried.</p>

<p>The whites were growing restless. A spirit was blowing
through them and uniting them. White workmen were becoming
frightened and then enraged at the black intruders,
who competed with them for food. Clerks who sat in the
“L’s” turned their nostrils away from the Negroes beside
them. Men of a hundred occupations, creeds and politics,
who had been individuals since the war, suddenly found
themselves once more a <span class="lock">unit—</span>a unit because of their common
color. The Negroes felt the unity of their blackness.</p>

<p>Freeman smelled the coming storm, like a thousand other
men, and prophesied about it freely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span></p>

<p>“It’s Sunday,” he said one afternoon as they sat in the
lobby of Robert’s hotel. “Well, perhaps I don’t blame you
much for not wanting to visit some of the black and tan
dance halls. I realize how you Southerners must feel about
it. But you haven’t anything to do today anyway, and you
must see the district. You can’t imagine what it’s like until
you see it for yourself.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go,” Robert consented reluctantly, “but it rather goes
against me to see a nigger walking with a white woman,
and—”</p>

<p>“Well, after we get public opinion organized you won’t
see a white girl walking with a coon!”</p>

<p>It was hot and sultry. It would have been hot even for
Corinth and one noticed waves of air rising from the pavement.
They rode to Twenty-Second street by elevated.</p>

<p>“There it starts,” said Freeman, pointing through the
window as they drew near the station. “See all those dirty,
brick tenements? And a few years ago there were only a
few thousand in the whole city. What’s going on there? It
looks like a mob.”</p>

<p>They reached the street and found it deserted save for
dusky heads in the windows.</p>

<p>“Every one must have gone over there,” said Freeman.
“Let’s see what’s doing. They look excited.”</p>

<p>“I’m not interested in any nigger meetings,” replied Robert.
“There’s the lake. It’s hot as the deuce. Let’s walk
down there.”</p>

<p>They had walked perhaps a block and a half east when
Freeman suddenly turned. Robert had also heard the sound.</p>

<p>“Gee, they’re coming!”</p>

<p>Robert turned. Perhaps fifty blacks, men and boys,
brandishing clubs and rocks, started at a dog trot up the
street, whooping and yelling.</p>

<p>“They’ve got us cut off from the station. Hamilton, come
on!”</p>

<p>“Why should we? They can’t be after us.”</p>

<p>Through an open window a mulatto, thrust her head.</p>

<p>“Hey, you white men,” she called. “They’s trouble and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
you betta all beat it while de beating’s good. I know you
just come, so you ain’t done nothing.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?”</p>

<p>Other heads appeared in windows, all talking and shouting
at once. A black child had been drowned by a white man
and the blacks were retaliating.</p>

<p>“Follow me!” yelled Freeman. “Around the corner to
the car line.” They set off and as they did so, the blacks
in their rear set up a cry and broke into a run. A stone
whistled through the air and hit the sidewalk two feet ahead.</p>

<p>As they turned the corner a Negro darted out of a door
with a yell, a stick in his hand. Hamilton, for the first time
in months, felt the old pain in his chest. A few more steps
and Freeman was drawing away. Robert suddenly whirled
around and struck out with all his force. It was his only
chance. The Negro stopped and ducked. The blow shot
over his head, but Robert’s shoulder crashed into his chin
and both fell. Robert felt the Negro wriggling beneath him,
even before he opened his eyes, and attempted to regain his
feet. He heard the shouts of the mob. He tried to rise.
The black man clutched at his coat. Robert yanked it away
and kicked himself loose and went staggering backward.
Some one was clutching him by the arm. The cries of the
mob grew louder.</p>

<p>“Automobile, c’mon!” It was Freeman pulling him
forward and shouting hoarsely. They ran into the road and
the speeding car suddenly slid to a halt trembling, its brakes
set.</p>

<p>“Don’t stop! They’re after us!” They scrambled over
the side into the back seat.</p>

<p>The car jumped ahead and went roaring down the road.
A volley of stones shot through the air and shattered the
wind-shield. The mob yelled.... Robert looked
around. The mob was running toward the lake. They
were out of the black belt, and the driver slackened his pace.</p>

<p>“What’s up?”</p>

<p>They told him.</p>

<p>“Every one of ’em ought to be lynched!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span></p>

<p>The man at his side swore loudly.</p>

<p>“We ought to go back and burn the entire district.”</p>

<p>Robert was panting.</p>

<p>“Now you Northerners’ll know what we’ve got to put
up with!”</p>

<p>“You’re right,” they swore.</p>

<p>In his room, Robert flung his coat across a chair and
threw himself upon the bed, exhausted. His chest was
heaving, he was wet with perspiration. Race riots in Chicago.
God! In Corinth they would burn the colored population!
He wondered what <em>would</em> happen here.</p>

<p>The door suddenly flew open.</p>

<p>“H’lo, Ham. What the devil! Are you sick?” It was
McCall.</p>

<p>“No,” he panted, “tired. Doing some sprinting.” He
untwisted himself and rose shakily. “But where have you
been? Gee, it’s great to see you again.”</p>

<p>“You must have got a bump,” remarked McCall, as they
shook hands. “Oh, I’ve just got back from a trip. I’ve
been getting some stuff on the Trick Track Tribe. Trying
to connect some atrocities with the Tribe. But what have
you been doing, anyway? Playing football?”</p>

<p>Robert laughed.</p>

<p>“Almost.”</p>

<p>He narrated his experiences in the black belt. McCall
whistled.</p>

<p>“When I was over in the office a little while ago, they told
me something about it. So you were in it? Do you know
how it started?”</p>

<p>“Only what a mulatto woman said, and she probably was
lying.”</p>

<p>“No, that was straight. They have a line at the Twenty-Sixth
street beach. The blacks bathe on one side and the
whites on the other. No law about it, but it’s just a rule
that both respect. Got a match?” He pulled out his cigarette
case. “Well, a little pickaninny crossed the line and
climbed on a raft. A white man threw a stone at him,
struck the kid and knocked him in the water. He drowned.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
He probably didn’t mean to do it. There was a white patrolman
in the district and when he took his time about
investigating and making an arrest, the blacks started organizing.
They had a few run-ins, but I thought that the thing
had probably died down.”</p>

<p>“No, about fifty of them were running toward the lake
when I saw them.”</p>

<p>“I suppose there’ll be trouble, then. Of course, only one
white man is to blame and he ought to be punished. But the
blacks feel the mass hatred against them. That rope keeping
them to one side of the beach is a symbol of it. The throwing
of the stone, another. Last week the race riots in Washington.
This week in Chicago. You’d think that such a
thing was impossible after the war.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, you’ll always have a color line.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’ll always have different <em>colors</em>, but I mean that
race prejudice, that unreasoning mass hatred. Levin was
right about the reaction following the war. Take the Trick
Track Tribe. The things I’ve found out about them. The
mayor of a little town in Kansas tarred and feathered,
for instance, simply because he said he was opposed to the
Tribe.”</p>

<p>“But look at all the niggers in Chicago, wouldn’t the
Tribe—?”</p>

<p>“No! A thousand times no! You think if you had the
mob organized to hate the Negro that everything would be
all right.”</p>

<p>“We’re not telling anyone to hate the nigger. I mean
the Tribe isn’t. The Tribe wants to put the nigger in his
place. And he isn’t in his place in Chicago.”</p>

<p>“Bunk! If you have a Tribe here, you will only crystallize
all the class hatred.”</p>

<p>“But it’s here.”</p>

<p>“Sure it’s here. But it’s the duty of intelligent men and
women to break it.”</p>

<p>“So you’d have equal social rights for the nigger, as the
nigger writers are advocating, would you? You’d have
them marry and—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span></p>

<p>“Don’t talk like a damn fool,” interrupted McCall. “Social
equality is nothing that can be regulated. It is up to the
individual. But you can insure social and economic justice,
at least in a measure, and you can at least try to keep racial
hatred from flaring up. Don’t you see what the Tribe is
doing? It is simply magnifying all the narrow prejudices
and hatreds. No man of intelligence could be reasoned into
joining it because of its demands. He joins because his
prejudices are aroused.”</p>

<p>“Why can’t he? Americanism. Pure womanhood—”</p>

<p>“Don’t talk like an ass. These terms don’t mean a blamed
thing. Everybody is for Americanism, those niggers who
chased you down the street as much as any one. Every one
is for pure womanhood, except a few degenerates whom
your prisons take care of. White supremacy is simply the
Tribe’s way of saying black hatred. That’s what the Tribe
stands <span class="lock">for—</span>hatred, hate of the black, of the Jew and of the
Catholic, hate of the labor <span class="lock">union—</span>it wants to abolish <em>needless</em>
strikes, with a Tribesman, I suppose, to decide which are
needless. And then there are states’ rights and prohibition.
If you appealed to a man’s reason, you couldn’t get any
members, because those planks automatically cut off every
one who is a Catholic, a Jew, a Negro, an alien, a Republican,
a radical, a believer in organized labor, a liberal or an
intellectual. And their insinuations about <span class="lock">Wilson—</span>Democrats.
Now, then, who’s left? What’s this junk?”</p>

<p>He stooped to pick up one of the folders of the Trick
Track Tribe, which had fallen out of Robert’s pocket. It
was headed “Knights of Columbus Oath, Fourth Degree.”</p>

<p>“What is this?”</p>

<p>As he read, McCall’s eyes blazed and the arteries of his
neck swelled. Robert bit his lips. The time had come. He
could no longer dissemble. It was a question of his friendship
with <span class="lock">McCall—</span>McCall his buddy of the <span class="lock">trenches—</span>or
loyalty to the Tribe. McCall’s voice was raised in anger:
“What’s this blasphemy!”</p>

<p>He read:</p>

<p>“‘When opportunity presents, I shall make and wage relentless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
war, open and secretly, against all heretics, Protestants
and Masons, as I am directed to do, to extirpate them
from the face of the whole earth; and that I will spare
neither age, sex nor condition and that I will hang, burn,
waste, boil, flay, strangle and burn alive these infamous
heretics; rip up the stomachs and wombs of their women
and crash their infants’ heads against the walls in order to
annihilate their execrable race.</p>

<p>“‘That when the same cannot be done openly, I will secretly
use the poisonous cup, the strangulation cord, the steel
of the poniard, or the leaden bullet ... as I at any time
may be directed so to do by any agent of the Pope or superior
of the Brotherhood of the Holy Father of the Society
of Jesus.’”</p>

<p>There was more of <span class="lock">it—</span>about denouncing allegiance to
Protestant countries and about voting for and employing
only Catholics.</p>

<p>McCall’s angry eyes took in the pile of booklets and cards
on the dresser. With one stride he crossed the room and
began tearing them into bits. Then his contorted, red face
grew pale, his lips quivered.</p>

<p>“Hamilton, <span class="lock">you—</span>you—” his voice choked. Robert held
his breath. “You contemptible spy. From Corinth! I
might have known! <span class="lock">And—</span>and—” He stood there for a
moment, speechless, his hands clenched, his body trembling.
He stepped forward and then suddenly turned to the door.</p>

<p>“Mac! Bill!” Robert found his voice. “Let me explain!”</p>

<p>“Explain? Hell!”</p>

<p>McCall reached the door and, without turning to look
around, opened it.</p>

<p>“Bill!”</p>

<p>The door slammed. McCall was gone. The torn leaflets
on the floor and the window curtains blew upward and fell
again. Robert took a step toward the door and stopped.
Bill was gone. In the mirror of his dresser Robert saw
how white he was.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XXXIV"><abbr title="Thirty-four">XXXIV</abbr></h2>
</div>

<p>Robert slept late the next morning, ate a combination
breakfast and luncheon and returned to his room. McCall!
Friendship! The torn leaflets had been removed by the
maid.</p>

<p>Robert removed his coat, collar and shirt and began, very
deliberately, to shave. He had never distributed the Knights
of Columbus oath. Freeman had assured him that whatever
might be the veracity of the articles in The Beacon, the
Knights of Columbus oath, at any rate, was accurate. It
had been obtained by the Tribe itself.</p>

<p>Robert dried his face. Why must a person always defend
what he has done? One may act simply on an <span class="lock">impulse—</span>because
some one else wants him to do something, because
the community in which he lives, his social set or public
opinion desires it. But once a person has acted, he builds up
reasons to justify himself. Take the Knights of Columbus
oath. He had not troubled to investigate it. He had
accepted it because it was part of the Tribe’s propaganda
and because his father, his mother, Margaret, his
social set, believed in the Tribe. The rational thing would
be to weigh its value, to investigate its <span class="lock">authenticity—</span>and
then to accept or reject it. It was the same way with
other propaganda. If it was false, Freeman was always inventing
excuses. Why had he not investigated their truth
before circulating them! And yet, Freeman had insisted
that the oath was true.</p>

<p>The telephone bell rang.</p>

<p>“Hello!” It was McCall. He was coming up. Robert
took a long breath. McCall! Robert had not expected him
to come back again. He wondered <span class="lock">why—</span>and was glad, immensely
glad. The door opened.</p>

<p>“God, I’m glad—” Robert held out his hand.</p>

<p>“Shut up!” McCall looked very pale and serious, his lips
tight. “I want you to listen to me! I think you’re either a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
scoundrel or a damn fool. I’ve thought it over all night and
I’ve decided to be charitable and call you a damn fool.”</p>

<p>Robert started to say something. McCall put up his hand.</p>

<p>“If you interrupt me, I’m going. And if I go, you’ll
never see me again. I said I decided that you were a damn
fool. I decided that you joined the Tribe because you
couldn’t get out of it or because you didn’t know its real
object. Most members don’t. They think they’re joining
some sort of a crusade. I think Lister is a sincere man, a
sincere fool, a fanatic who would have fitted in somewhere
beautifully in the Middle Ages and who didn’t know any
more about the meaning of Christianity than the fanatics
who burned heretics and witches three hundred years ago.
That includes Catholics as well as Protestants. I’m not
handing myself anything.</p>

<p>“Griffith I think is a <span class="lock">crook—</span>I say I <em>think</em> he <span class="lock">is—</span>because
he personally gets a rake-off on every member, because he
sells robes and masks at a profit that the Tribe would boycott
a Jew for making, and because he sells the muddy river
water used in your Tribal initiations for ten dollars a quart.
I can’t conceive of any man with the broad mission he says
he has, starting out by overcharging the brothers who are
to carry out that mission with him. If you are an official,
you know that these are facts and you also know that you get
a rake-off for each new member. It is to your interest and
to the interest of every Tribal officer to get as many memberships
as you <span class="lock">can—</span>no matter how much class and racial
hatred you spread in getting <span class="lock">them—</span>because it brings you
actual money. If you can make people believe that the
Pope is trying to control the American government, or that
Jews, who form about three per cent of the population, are
trying to overthrow all government, or that Negroes, who
have been persecuted and tortured all their lives and are
afraid to move, are plotting with the Bolsheviki or the
Hindus to overthrow civilization, it means three dollars for
Mr. Griffith, four dollars for the salesman who calls himself
a Bogey and one dollar for the state salesman or Grand
<span class="lock">Bogey—</span>per convert.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span></p>

<p>“But I won’t inquire into your motives for joining the
Tribe. I shall assume that they were worthy and that you
were simply gullible. The Tribe’s antagonism to the Catholic
is evidently based on its conception of the relation
between the Papacy and the United States. The Tribe evidently
believes, or pretends to believe, that the Papacy means
to control the government of the United States, and that
spiritual allegiance to the Pope in some way interferes with
secular allegiance to the government of the United States.
I say that these are the reasons for the Tribe’s opposition to
the Catholic, because the Tribe professes to believe in the
freedom of worship. In other words, admittedly the religion
of the Catholic, and similarly of the Jew, have nothing to do
with the Tribe’s opposition.</p>

<p>“Now, Hamilton, if I can prove to you that the Catholic
church is not attempting to control our government and the
Catholic church in no way interferes with one’s loyalty to
his country, will you promise to resign from the Tribe? If
the Tribe is wrong, you will want to resign. If I am wrong,
if the Catholic church does mean interference with my
Americanism, I will not want to be a <span class="lock">Catholic—</span>and I will
quit the church. Is that fair?”</p>

<p>“<span class="lock">Yes—</span>you give up the church or I give up the Tribe.”</p>

<p>They shook hands. It seemed fair enough. Robert had
joined the Tribe because he believed it stood for certain
principles. That it attacked certain institutions, not because
of blind prejudice, but for definite reasons. If these reasons
proved false, there was no reason for the Tribe’s <span class="lock">existence—</span>no
reason for Robert belonging to it. To continue to be a
Tribesman under those circumstances would be dishonest.
It would be lending his force, his personality, to a lie.</p>

<p>“Now for the proof,” said McCall. “Hell, what do you
or I know about it anyway? Father Callahan does. And
if he doesn’t convince you, I’ll quit the church.”</p>

<p>Father Callahan, of St. Gesu Church, proved to be a
pleasant, ruddy-faced man of charming manners and ready
knowledge. He received them in his library.</p>

<p>“It was quite right of you to come to me,” he smiled, “because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
many of the attacks of the Trick Track Tribe have
been made against the Jesuits and, inasmuch as I, myself,
am a member of the Society of <span class="lock">Jesus—</span>by the way, Mr.
Hamilton, I observe that the Knights of the Trick Track
Tribe boast of the most sublime lineage in all history, but I
believe that the organization to which I belong may lay claim
to a still more sublime lineage.” He smiled. “The lineage
of the Catholic church can be traced back some 1850 years
before the origin of the Tribe, granting even that the present
Tribe is the legitimate descendant of the original Tribe
formed in 1867. Inasmuch, however, as the old Tribe was
abolished, both by its founders and by the federal government,
one may well question how the present Tribe may
justly claim to inherit its lineage, which was not too sublime
to make the fathers of the order heartily regret that they
had ever founded it.”</p>

<p>Father Callahan had a rather delightful way of imparting
the mildest of sarcasms. He leaned forward and touched
Robert on the knee.</p>

<p>“And I believe the Tribe has also called itself the most
dauntless organization known to man. Whether it is really
more dauntless than the secret societies of the heathen savages
who also fight behind grotesque <span class="lock">masks—</span>some splendid
examples of which you may be able to find at the Field
Museum or, at any rate, in any good book on <span class="lock">anthropology—</span>still
the fact remains that members of the society of which
I am a member have also accomplished certain dauntless
deeds. There is no natural monopoly of that quality. You
may remember that Father Marquette, for instance, preceded
me, in the name of the church, some three hundred
years ago, as did also Father Hennepin. You may remember
that Joliet and La Salle also showed themselves not lacking
in bravery in their explorations which opened up Canada
and the entire Northwest. The first trappers and traders
with the Indians, who became the first merchants of Chicago
and the founders of its first industry, also belonged to the
Catholic Church.</p>

<p>“By the way,”—the priest rose—“this discourse may strike<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
you as rather dry. But national prohibition will not go into
effect until January and I don’t suppose I should be
offending even the keen love of law and order of a Tribesman
by offering him a little wine and cake. If you excuse
me for a minute?”</p>

<p>Robert settled back comfortably in his chair, his nervousness
entirely gone.</p>

<p>“Well, what do you think of him?” asked McCall with
a smile.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll bet he makes religion attractive.”</p>

<p>“Certainly! Why shouldn’t it be? It ought to be the
most sublime thing in the world.” They laughed at the accidental
use of the word “sublime.” “I look at religion as the
most beautiful symbolism in life. I couldn’t worship in an
ugly church or under the guidance of a cold and narrow
minister or priest.”</p>

<p>Father Callahan appeared in the doorway, his ruddy face
smiling and his merry blue eyes sparkling. A servant followed,
bearing a small tray on which were three small glasses
of red wine and a plate of cake. The latter placed the tray
on the table and the priest offered the glasses, invoked a
blessing on the food and drink, and took a swallow.</p>

<p>“Ah! Now,” he said, “the really very silly notion that
allegiance to the Pope interferes with the loyalty any citizen
owes his country, has been exploded a long time ago and is
used by no one save a few bigots who do not themselves
credit the nonsense they utter. It is really remarkable how
such ideas linger, yet I notice that this forms the real basis
of the Tribe’s opposition to the Catholic as such. Of course,
the church is Catholic and its missionaries go forth to all
lands seeking converts. Every human being, we believe, has
a soul, and before God all souls are equal. The Church of
Christ is not ashamed that many of its members are of the
eastern and southern European countries, whose immigrants
at present may be regarded as undesirable by American
statesmen. We rather take pride that the church has considered
the soul of no man unworthy of saving. Our statesmen
can probably best determine which elements are most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
needed in making up the population of the United States.
But the church maintains that the desirability of no man as
a citizen is ever diminished by his belonging to the Catholic
church.</p>

<p>“A man can be a good subject either of a republic or a
monarchy and, at the same time, be a devoted adherent of
the Holy See. Even non-believers in Catholic doctrine have
come to recognize that the better Catholic an individual is,
the better citizen he therefore becomes of the country in
which he lives.”</p>

<p>Father Callahan took a bite of cake and another swallow
of wine.</p>

<p>“The old absurdity,” he went on, “of owing allegiance to
a foreign potentate, which was the charge made against
American Catholics in Know Nothing times, has been rarely
heard and would have been relegated to that obscurity which
it deserves except for the sudden rise of the Trick Track
Tribe. Spiritual allegiance to the Pope will never interfere
with the duties an honest state exacts from its citizens, but,
on the contrary, will inspire each citizen to perform his
duties better and more conscientiously. But you must have
some more cake. That’s right.”</p>

<p>The priest rose, walked to a bookcase and, after studying
it a minute, pulled out a volume.</p>

<p>“Can you prove what you have just told him, father?”
asked McCall.</p>

<p>“That is exactly what I am about to do. Although I have
some authority in the church, you, Mr. Hamilton, will want
some greater authority than mine. Have you ever heard of
the Baltimore Council? Shortly after Pope Leo the Thirteenth
had conferred with the American prelates in Rome,
a plenary council of the Catholic Church of the United
States was ordered, late in 1884. The acts of this council
were approved by the Pope and are enforced throughout the
United States. Now, very fortunately, this very subject of
church and state was discussed by the fathers of the Baltimore
Council and this, by the approval of the Holy See, is
the official position of the Catholic Church.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span></p>

<p>The priest turned the leaves, found the proper page and
handed the book to Robert.</p>

<p>“We repudiate with equal earnestness,” he read, “the assertion
that we need to lay aside any of our devotedness to our
church to be true Americans; the insinuation that we need
to lay aside any of our love for our country’s principles and
institutions to be faithful Catholics. To argue that the Catholic
Church is hostile to our great republic, because she
teaches that ‘there is no power but from God’; because,
therefore, back of the events which led to the formation of
the republic, she sees the providence of God leading to that
issue and, back of our country’s laws, the authority of God
as their <span class="lock">sanction—</span>this is evidently so illogical and contradictory
an accusation that we are astonished to hear it advanced
by persons of ordinary intelligence.... To both
the Almighty and to His instruments we look with grateful
reverence, and to maintain the inheritance of freedom which
they have left us, our Catholic citizens will be found to stand
forward as one man, ready to pledge anew their lives, their
fortunes and their sacred honor. No less illogical should be
the notion that there is aught in the free spirit of our American
institutions incompatible with perfect docility to the
Church of Christ.”</p>

<p>The next sentence Robert read several times. It seemed
to strike at the union of church and state, <span class="lock">although—</span>and
this seemed <span class="lock">natural—</span>such union was blamed upon the selfishness
of secular monarchs, seeking greater power. It was
natural that the Catholic Church, if it now condemned this
union, should see in it, not a usurpation of secular authority
by the church, but of ecclesiastical power by the state.</p>

<p>“Narrow, insular, national views and jealousies concerning
ecclesiastical authority and church organization may have
sprung naturally enough from the selfish policy of certain
rulers and nations in bygone times, but they find no sympathy
in the spirit of the true American Catholic.”</p>

<p>“I see,” said Robert gravely, handing the book back. It
seemed queer that both the Catholics and the Tribesmen
should issue proclamations against what was probably the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
same thing. It was like the two knights fighting each other
all day because one declared the shield was red and the other
that it was black and then discovering, as they lay exhausted
on the ground, that the shield was black on one side and red
on the other. Tribesmen and Know Nothingers feared that
the church wished to control the state; the Catholic fathers
that the state should try to control the church.</p>

<p>“Have you the real fourth degree oath of the Knights of
Columbus?” asked McCall.</p>

<p>“I don’t think it’s necessary,” said Robert.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is. You must be convinced beyond a shadow of
a doubt. The Knights of Columbus, Father, are supposed
to be trying to seize control of the state by, well, it amounts
to murder. Read this.”</p>

<p>He handed over the circular. The priest looked at it and
frowned.</p>

<p>“This is a more serious charge,” he said. “I can forgive
a person for being honestly mistaken in his view of the relation
of the Catholic Church to the state, but this oath must
have been written by one or more persons actuated by a
hatred of Catholicism and who knew that it must be false.
It is not a case of honest ignorance.”</p>

<p>He continued reading, his eyebrows drawn together in a
scowl and nodding his head from time to time. Finally he
looked up.</p>

<p>“Mr. Hamilton, that charge is not new. It is surprising
that it should bob up again, inasmuch as the real oath of the
Knights of Columbus was made public several years ago in
the course of an investigation into the matter by the Masonic
bodies. It was also made public in the course of a
contested election case. The false oath, this oath I have
here, had been circulated to defeat a candidate who was a
fourth degree knight. Inasmuch as the real oath has already
been published by our own courts and by the Masons, who
are hardly pro-Catholic, I should be violating no confidence
in repeating it. It runs: I swear to support the constitution
of the United States. I pledge myself as a Catholic citizen
and Knight of Columbus to enlighten myself fully upon my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
duties as a citizen and to conscientiously perform such duties
entirely in the interest of my country and regardless of all
personal consequences. I pledge myself to do all in my
power to preserve the integrity and purity of the ballot, and
to promote reverence and respect for law and order. I
promise to practise my religion openly and without ostentation
and to so conduct myself in public affairs and in the
exercise of public virtue as to reflect nothing but credit upon
our Holy Church, to the end that she may flourish and our
country prosper to the greater honor and glory of God.’”</p>

<p>Robert’s brain whirled. He felt himself growing angry.
His fists involuntarily clenched and he bit his lips. Lies,
lies, lies. It had been nothing but lies ever since he had
joined the Tribe. Lies against the Negro, lies against the
Catholic, lies against the Jew. When anything untruthful or
mistaken or illogical had been pointed out, the leaders had
always disclaimed responsibility. They had always disclaimed
responsibility for violence, yet wherever the Tribe
flourished the strongest violence and these damnable lies
were most numerous.</p>

<p>“Show him the official Knights of Columbus ritual,”
McCall was saying, and, although Robert protested that it
was not necessary, Father Callahan procured the volume,
opened it at the proper page and showed it to him.</p>

<p>“There’s some nonsense about the prediction of Abraham
Lincoln that some day there would be a clash between Rome
and this country, something about seeing a cloud coming
from Rome which forebode war.”</p>

<p>“Please don’t——” began Robert.</p>

<p>“You must. Let him look through your complete works
of Lincoln.”</p>

<p>In spite of his protests the ponderous volumes were pulled
out of their shelves and laid on the table.</p>

<p>“This is supposed to contain everything Lincoln ever
wrote or said,” McCall turned to the index volume. “Now
look for Catholic. Now try Rome. Now try Pope. Now
try Papacy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span></p>

<p>Robert looked. There was nothing. There were two
short letters in which Lincoln repudiated rumors that he
belonged to the Know Nothing party. Nothing about Rome
or the Pope or Catholicism.</p>

<p>“If you can find any such statement by Lincoln in any
authenticated work in the Chicago Public Library, in any
library, or in any original document, I’ll believe you,” said
McCall.</p>

<p>“No, that’s unnecessary,” said Robert. “It’s a standard
work. It would be of such tremendous importance, any
statement like that, that it would undoubtedly appear in any
standard collection of letters and addresses. It would be of
such importance that it would appear in our histories. No,
you’re right, Bill.” There was a lump in his throat. “Can
you forgive me? I am——”</p>

<p>“No, you won’t resign yet,” said McCall, “there are certain
lies about the Jews. Father Callahan could probably
answer most of them, I could answer some, but I am going
to take you to Levin’s. Levin’s father is a rabbi.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Robert, “it’s not necessary.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you’re going.”</p>

<p>“Of course, there is one thing,” broke in the priest with
a smile, “there is no one body that represents the Jews as
the Holy See represents Catholicism. There are Zionist
Jews and anti-Zionist Jews, orthodox and reformed, German
and Russian and Polish and Hungarian and English. There
is no one conference that all the rabbis attend. In other
words, the Jews are not a unit as the Catholics are. I could
point out what the Baltimore council said, and that meant
the official attitude of the Catholic church. There is no such
official office of the Jews. There is no Jewish pope, in other
words, who could state the position of all Jews about anything.
Take the ridiculous charge that they plan the overthrow
of all governments. Every Jew would deny it, but
there is no central Jewish authority that you could consult.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right, father,” said McCall. “Levin’s father is
one of the orthodox rabbis. He still wears a skull cap. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
still keeps the old dietary rules. He is a Zionist. He belongs
to a lodge that represents the most Jewish of the Jews of
Chicago. If he can’t tell you what Jews are thinking about
and what their ideas and ideals are, nobody else can.”</p>

<p>The priest shook hands with them, made a passing allusion
to the joy that attends the recovery of one sheep that has
strayed from the fold, and invited them to come again.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XXXV"><abbr title="Thirty-five">XXXV</abbr></h2>
</div>

<p>Robert wondered what sort of home Levin would live
in. Outside of Levin himself, in fact, his dealings with Jews
had been extremely limited. He had met a few in his classes
at Harvard, where they appeared perhaps a little more studious,
more eager to acquire education, than the average students,
but he had developed no friendships among them.</p>

<p>They took a west-side elevated and passed a district thick
with stores and traffic. The rabbi’s home, however, was on
the second floor of a three-story apartment building, facing
a park, a rather peaceful retreat from the shopping district
a few blocks away.</p>

<p>The home was like any of a dozen apartments Robert had
seen in New York and <span class="lock">Chicago—</span>harmonious mahogany
furniture, oriental rugs, good pictures, a baby grand piano,
floor lamps. Except for a polished brass candelabra, with
seven candle sticks, that stood on the table near the window,
a hammered brass Russian samovar and a prominence of
other hammered brass objects, there was nothing to set it
off as distinctly Jewish. Oh yes, in the tall book shelves that
rose from either side of the fireplace there were many old
books with Hebrew letters stamped on them.</p>

<p>A rather plump schoolgirl, the doctor’s sister, had opened
the door and ushered them through the reception hall into
the living room.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. McCall, Jack’s expecting you,” she said.
“Won’t you come in? Papa is just advising someone.”</p>

<p>She excused herself to summon her brother. Dr. Levin’s
first name was Jacob, but his sister, Estelle, had given him
the more American name of Jack.</p>

<p>Robert saw an elderly gentleman, with a black skull cap
and long white beard, evidently the rabbi himself, talking
animatedly with a little black-bearded fellow, who kept nodding
his head. The taller man looked something like Jack,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
like Jack in a patriarchal beard and with little foreign mannerisms.
They were talking in some foreign jargon.</p>

<p>“<em>Nu</em>, you send him to me and I will advise him as though
he was my own son.”</p>

<p>The other man stopped nodding his head and began to
shake it slowly from side to side.</p>

<p>“It will be for you a great blessing.” A few more words
and he left.</p>

<p>Jack came <span class="lock">in—</span>it was surprising how dressing carefully and
going clean-shaven modernized one’s appearance. Their
features were very similar, yet the elder Levin had a patriarchal,
almost oriental, appearance. Jack introduced Robert.</p>

<p>“Ah, yes, that is the Hamilton my son has been telling me
about.” He spoke with a foreign, sing-song, balanced intonation
and a slight lisp. He divided each word into its
syllables, as though he were reading slowly out loud.</p>

<p>“<em>Nu</em>, sit down, Mr. Hamilton. You are just in time for
supper. It’s too bad you couldn’t come Friday.”</p>

<p>Hamilton murmured something about not knowing it was
so late.</p>

<p>“It is a great blessing,” remarked the rabbi, “to have a
guest, so you must stay on my account.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Levin, short, plump and brown-eyed, with a brown
wig, entered the room.</p>

<p>“Ah, we hear from you by Jackie a whole lot,” she said.</p>

<p>The doctor grinned good-naturedly, evident amused at
the quaint old-world accent and manners of his parents.</p>

<p>“Now, you want I should tell you about the Jew,” said
the rabbi, stroking his beard. “But take a seat first. The
trouble is you come here for an hour or two hours and expect
to learn everything about the Jews, like you learn a
recipe for a sponge cake. You must study and read.”</p>

<p>Robert glanced at McCall. The latter had evidently prepared
Rabbi Levin and Father Callahan, had probably
phoned them before coming to his room. It was a conspiracy,
he could see, for his own good.</p>

<p>“<em>Nu</em>, what do you want to know? There is no mysticism<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
in Judaism. It is an open book. There it is, everything.”
He pointed to a Bible.</p>

<p>“But he wants to know something about the Jews that will
offset this Trick Track Tribe propaganda.”</p>

<p>“What, Trick Track Tribe?” The old man shrugged his
shoulders. “Craziness. Foolishness. It can’t last. Mr.
Hamilton, can a bad thing, an untrue thing, last? No?
Well, then, how can the Tribe live? What do they say?
Ask me any questions and I will try to answer them for you
as best I can.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Levin,” said McCall, “the Tribe accuses the Jews of
planning to overthrow all the Gentile governments of the
world through the Third Internationale. Isn’t that the argument,
Hamilton?” Robert nodded.</p>

<p>“<em>Nu</em>, they do us credit. They flatter us,” said the rabbi.
“How can it be that the Jews, who are only about three per
cent of the population, should control the whole world? Is
it sense?” He shrugged his shoulders and cocked his head
to one side. “Jews? What Jews? You talk as if Jews was
a little society, like a lodge. There are American Jews and
Russian Jews, German Jews and French Jews, Republican
Jews and Democratic Jews, radical Jews and conservative
Jews. It’s not like they have a pope to tell them what they
shall do.”</p>

<p>“But how do the orthodox Jews feel about internationalism?”</p>

<p>“Ah, the orthodox Jews. They are the Zionists. They
are always dreaming that they shall get back to Palestine.
So how can they be internationalists? They are nationalists,
they want that even the Jews should have their own nation,
so how can they be both nationalists and internationalists at
the same time?”</p>

<p>“But isn’t Trotsky a Jew and most of the Bolshevik leaders?”</p>

<p>“Trotsky is no longer a Jew. He has been, what you call
it in the Catholic Church, excommunicated from the Jewish
Synagogue. His parents are Jews, good Jews, and they
mourn him like he was a dead one. There can be no religious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
Jews among the Bolsheviks, but there are some Jews,
by birth we admit <span class="lock">it—</span>who are leaders. <em>Nu</em>, Lenine is a
Gentile. So what does that show? But most of the leaders
are not Jews. It is true that there are more leaders among
them in proportion to their population. But that is because
most of the Jews in Russia live in the big cities where the
Bolshevik movement started. And the Jews are better educated
than the average Russian. So they are naturally more
highly represented in the offices. Trotsky is the only great
Jewish <span class="lock">leader—</span>the head of the army. But Lenine comes
from the nobility and many of the Russian radicals are from
the old nobility. But you can’t say that the Russian nobility
is radical, can you? But there are no Jews in the <i>tchaika</i>,
which is responsible for the reign of terror. They are all
Letts. The Jews are mostly translaters, because they are
educated to speak several tongues, teachers, minor officials.
But they are simply officials, appointed by the government,
and they would hold the same jobs should it be a Kerensky
again at the head. It’s just like the communists have placed
the old Czarist generals at the head of the different army
corps. What should they do? They have to fight for the
government or they get killed. But the generals under Czar
Nicholas who are now leading the Red armies, are they also
Bolsheviks? No, a religious Jew or a Zionist, whether he
observes all the religion or not, he cannot be an internationalist.”</p>

<p>“How about the protocols of the Elders of Zion?” asked
McCall.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” asked Robert.</p>

<p>“That’s the book that’s supposed to be the basis of the
accusation that the Jews have a world-wide plot against all
governments.”</p>

<p>“Have you read it?” asked Rabbi Levin.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Then it is hard to speak about it. If you read it you
would see right away that it was a forgery. In the first
place, Elders of Zion. You see, the people who wrote it,
forgot that there is no such a thing as a Jewish central organization,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
like, say, the Holy See for the Catholics. There
is no such thing as the Elders of Zion. It couldn’t be, because
there is no such thing as Zion, that is a united Jewish
people politically. The Elders of Zion are supposed to be
some official body meeting in connection with the first Zionist
convention. But the Zionist convention was open, so that
all reporters could come there, so how is it no one should
know of such a plot? Of course, if the Zionists would have
wanted no governments they would not spend their time and
money and risk their lives now in settling Palestine for a
government of the Jews. But why should I tell you it is a
forgery? You know what it is, historical method?”</p>

<p>Robert had not studied it, but he knew what it was from
college. Students majoring in history and graduate students
took it.</p>

<p>“Well, you know, you can tell by examining documents
whether they are true or fakes. It’s wrong here. It’s wrong
there. A contradiction. You know how it is. Well, a much
better man than I, and a Gentile, has called it a forgery.
Who is that? You should know, the head from the greatest
detective force in the world, Scotland Yard, Sir Basil
Thompson.”</p>

<p>Robert laughed. “Well, that’s proof enough for me.”</p>

<p>At the table there were queer dishes. There was herring
for an appetiser, a cold soup, which they called <i>borsht</i>, which
was red, tasted of beets and was eaten with cream. Appetizing
envelopes of dough filled with cheese and eaten with
sour cream, called <i>blinches</i>. <i>Strudel</i>, a sort of crisp tart
filled with prunes.</p>

<p>“It’s the most delicious food I’ve eaten since I left Paris,”
laughed Robert. Mrs. Levin beamed her pleasure.</p>

<p>Every one was talking at once. Explaining this and that.
The significance of the candelabra. Why the rabbi wore a
skull cap. Why little <i>mazzuzas</i>, painted wooden things,
hung at the doors. Explaining the food. The rabbi, like
his son, had a habit of skipping from one subject to <span class="lock">another—</span>literature,
art, music, sociology, anthropology. Robert had
always had an idea that Jewish learning was confined to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
the Talmud, mysterious books of ancient and medieval lore.
But he found the rabbi’s knowledge was quite as modern as
the most enlightened cosmopolite might wish.</p>

<p>“Most of these customs are simply customs,” said the
Rabbi. “Why do you take off your cap to a lady? Custom.
For the same reason I wear a hat. The simpler people
make up explanations. See that <i>mazzuza</i> hanging at the
door? It contains a little bit of holy scrip. Superstitious
people think it drives away the devils. Other people hang
it up because they think it makes a pretty curio. Like you
might have a Buddhist idol, without believing in it, or a
horseshoe. Some customs are nice customs. There is sentiment
in back of them. So I stick to ’em. My children,
<em>nu</em>, they are Americans. They grow away from it.”</p>

<p>McCall tried to turn the conversation back to the Tribe,
while Robert protested that he had been convinced. To
appease McCall, the rabbi had showed them the constitution
of the Sons of Israel and assured them that the oaths were
as innocent as that of the real fourth degree of the Knights
of Columbus. The Tribe had accused the Sons of Israel
of attempting to carry out the “international revolution.”</p>

<p>“Even if everything the Tribe says about <span class="lock">everybody—</span>Jews,
Catholics, Negroes, <span class="lock">foreigners—</span>was absolutely true,
still it would be wrong,” said the rabbi. “Why? Because
either your Tribe is an invisible government, or it isn’t. If
it isn’t, you are getting money under false pretenses, because
you claim it is. And if it is an invisible government, they
are transferring the government from its proper offices and
should be arrested for the same reason that the communists
were arrested when they also tried to set up an invisible
government. Invisible government, no matter for what
purposes, has no place here.”</p>

<p>At the end of the meal, they returned to the living room,
where Estelle, upon the insistence of her parents, played
surprisingly well, some selections from <cite>Rimsky-Korsakov</cite>.
The rabbi kept time with his head, shaking it rhythmically
from side to side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span></p>

<p>“When she plays I can just hear the shepherds blowing
on their pipes,” he said.</p>

<p>But McCall insisted on thrashing out the Jewish question
still further.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Hamilton at length. “Of course those
charges are all false. I don’t think any sane person is afraid
that a handful of Jews, especially disorganized as they are,
could ever gain control of the world. That’s preposterous.
The real objection to him is that he is different, a foreigner,
an inferior element. Not that I believe it, but—”</p>

<p>Dr. Levin, who had allowed his father to carry out the
bulk of the argument, could keep back no longer, and he
took up the challenge.</p>

<p>“I am not going to point out the qualities of the Hebrew
race, Hamilton, because, it is not for qualities or lack of
qualities that a mob hates. And that’s what your Tribe is.
It is the same sort of a mob that forms the secret society
of the savage tribes of dark Africa. There they kill a
man not because he is better or worse than they are, but
because he is alien. Among the savages of the Amazon,
it is enough that a man has wandered from his tribe six
months for him to be murdered for his alienism.</p>

<p>“You know that your very religion is Jewish, and that
the first Christian martyrs, whom you reverence, were all
Jews or converts to Judaism. You know that Jews have
always contributed more than their proportion of the distinguished
men of every nation in which they have lived. But
distinction in talent or in wealth only fans the mob’s hate.
It was so in Spain during the Inquisition, where the Jews
had married into the proudest Spanish families and occupied
the highest positions, and it is so here today. The mob
which sneers at the poor man because he is poor, howls
for the blood of the rich man because he is rich. And it
is among those same bigots that the conflicting cries arise
against the Jewish banker and the Jewish peddler.</p>

<p>“It is possible that you yourself carry the taint of Jewish
blood in your veins, for wherever the Jews have lived, they
have intermarried. They have both converted and been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
converted. In the greater cities of Europe from 10 to 50
per cent of all Jews intermarry. The one thing that distinguishes
the Jew from the other modern races is his
retention of the old faith. It is his faith alone that makes
him unwelcome.</p>

<p>“You call the Jew an alien, but if he is an alien then
every inhabitant of America excepting the red Indian is
an alien. The first Jews came to America with Christopher
Columbus, and there is even evidence that Columbus himself
was a Jew by birth, although a Catholic by religion. Jews
fought with the Dutch against the Swedes in New Amsterdam,
with Washington in the French and Indian war, and
once more with Washington in the war that won freedom
for the colonies. A Jew helped Robert Morris finance the
Revolution and it was another Jew who financed the Union
at the most critical point of the Civil War. A Jew prevented
the delivery of two armored ships to the Confederate
states which would probably have broken the blockade and
won the Civil War for the South. But, of course, you’re
a Southerner. In your own state, Georgia, the oldest settlers
are descendants of Jews.</p>

<p>“But there is no use reasoning with a Tribesman. He is
one of a crowd, and a crowd lacks reason. Get your crowd
swayed by the spirit and it matters not what reason you
give it for its <span class="lock">hatred—</span>difference of race, of belief, of appearance.
Tell the crowd that being black is wrong, or
being a Catholic, or being a Jew. It is but enough to point
out that the objects of its wrath are different from it. Show
it an ideal like Anglo-Saxonism. It will not stop to reflect
that the greatest Anglo-Saxon nation in the world, Great
Britain, is a mixture of primitive Briton, Celt, Teuton, Norman,
Jew, of Catholic and Protestant. In the name of
Anglo-Saxonism it will strike blindly against the elements
of its own population, whose very diversity made the greatest
Anglo-Saxon nation what it is.</p>

<p>“During the World War it was necessary to organize
this nation into a huge crowd, instilled with the single idea
of patriotism. Then it was a matter of self-defense, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
in the same way you can organize other crowds and inspire
them to the highest deeds. The old Ku Klux Klan was
undoubtedly actuated by the highest of ideals. But it broke
away from its leaders and became a mob. It became an
evil graver to the law and order of the nation which it
started to protect than the forces which it combatted. That
is exactly what will happen to the Trick Track Tribe. That
is exactly what is happening to it today. Men and women
are being boycotted, banished from their homes, tarred and
feathered, flogged and murdered. Officially it may not be
the work of the Trick Track Tribe. Officials may disclaim
responsibility. But they cannot disclaim responsibility for
forming the mob and then directly or indirectly inciting it.
Griffith may be the wisest of men, Lister the noblest and
most sincere, but they can no more control the mob of their
formation, than could the wise and sincere men who formed
the Ku Klux Klan stop its reign of terrorism. That took
a greater crowd, actuated by a greater ideal.</p>

<p>“The Trick Track Tribe has already shown a record of
atrocities wherever it has formed a considerable element of
the population. If its leaders have directed them, the Tribe
already stands convicted. If its leaders have not directed
them, the Tribe already confesses that the mob has broken
out of its control. But just as the federal government,
backed by aroused public opinion, was able to overthrow
the old Klan, so will the government, once more representing
aroused public opinion, overthrow the present Tribe.”</p>

<p>“You’re right,” cried Robert. “You are absolutely right.
Perhaps you didn’t know it. I’m a member of the Tribe
<span class="lock">myself—</span>but I won’t be anymore.”</p>

<p>No one showed surprise.</p>

<p>“We knew it all the time,” said Rabbi Levin. “Only
we don’t believe in using the same tactics as the Tribe.
We wanted to convince you.”</p>

<p>“You, you—” Robert was bewildered. It seemed incomprehensible.</p>

<p>“Sure,” said the rabbi. “See, isn’t it better we should
sit down at the table and eat <i>borsht</i> and <i>blinches</i> and talk<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
it over like men with sense, instead of we should kidnap
you with white masks like hoodlums and try to convince
you with a bath of tar and feathers, which never convinces
anyway? Wouldn’t it be better, if the Tribe really had
something against the Catholics or the Jews, they should
bring it <span class="lock">out—</span>nice, quiet, like <span class="lock">gentlemen—</span>in the open? If
they told the Catholic priests and the Jewish rabbis anything
they know bad about them, wouldn’t the Catholics and
the Jews themselves be the first ones to stop it? Or couldn’t
they bring it up in a court if they were traitors to their
country, and get the services from the department of justice
and maybe deport them like it was the anarchists?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Mr. Levin, that’s the American way to settle things,
in the open!”</p>

<p>“And it’s also the Jewish way,” said Levin.</p>

<p>“And the Catholic.”</p>

<p>“And it’s the Protestant,” said Hamilton. “If it wasn’t
for my oath I’d bring the whole thing out in the open!”</p>

<p>“What oath?” asked Dr. Levin.</p>

<p>“My oath to the Tribe.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you remember that other oath we all <span class="lock">took—</span>McCall,
a Catholic; you, a Protestant, and I, a Jew?”</p>

<p>“What oath?”</p>

<p>“The oath to protect our <span class="lock">country—</span>the oath we all took
when we got our commissions in the army. Are you, in
letting this un-American Tribe hatred spread, living up to
that?”</p>

<p>“God, no!”</p>

<p>Robert rose.</p>

<p>“I’m going to hand in my resignation now!”</p>

<p>“It’s eight o’clock now. Wait until morning,” urged
Levin.</p>

<p>“No, I won’t wait another minute.”</p>

<p>But the office of the Dearborn Statistical Bureau, where
Freeman sometimes worked at night, was locked and Robert,
after sending a telegram to Griffith, went to his room.</p>

</div>

<p>The rioting begun on Sunday fanned into a race struggle
all the smoldering passions and hatreds that the Armistice
had once suppressed. White men of fifty different creeds,
nationalities and politics, who had begun by hating the
unreasoning hatred of the Hun for the un-Teutonic, and
who had grown intolerant of the arrogant intolerance of the
blond beast, suddenly flared into fury against the blacks.</p>

<p>Blacks had disappeared from the streets except in their
own belt, around which howled and stormed the white mob.
This was no case of punishing the blacks who precipitated
the first attack on the beach, but of punishing <em>all</em> blacks.
The cry was not “Get the nigger!” but “Get the niggers!”
Difference of color, blackness, was the sole object of the
crowd’s fury.</p>

<p>On their side, the blacks fought against whiteness. They
had begun by stoning, not the white man who had thrown
the first stone, but all the whites upon whom they could
lay their black hands. In gangs they had waylaid and assaulted
any one they met, regardless of age and of sex,
because he was white. The black child who had been so
cruelly murdered had become a symbol to them of all the
suffering of the colored at the hands of the white. All that
they had undergone under the lash and the knife in the <span class="lock">Congo—</span>the
fruitful colony of gallant <span class="lock">Belgium—</span>all that they had
borne in slave marts, on cotton plantations, in dismal
swamps, at the whipping-post, on the faggot <span class="lock">pile—</span>all the
concentrated injustice of the ages, all the intolerance of
bleeding centuries, lay in the sacrifice of this beloved pickaninny.
Out of injustice and tolerance had sprung an
answering injustice and intolerance. And now in answer
to it the white mob screamed without.</p>

<p>Gangs of whites and blacks filled the streets, attacked
with rocks, bricks, knives and bullets. Snipers picked off
their foe from the top windows of brick tenements. Motor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
trucks, manned by armed bands, plunged through the
crowded streets, showering bullets. Firebrands burned a
hundred buildings and attempted to destroy the entire Negro
district. Three thousand men, women and children were
rendered homeless. By Monday night twenty-five blacks
and whites had sobbed out their lives in the battle of color,
their bodies lay on the marble slabs of the public <span class="lock">morgue—</span>a
sacrifice to the God of Intolerance.</p>

<p>In Tuesday’s paper Robert read about the rioting and
heard unconfirmed details, horrible exaggerations, from the
lips of excited men who stood around the lobby. Robert
felt glad that he no longer belonged to the Tribe. Though
the riots were no part of the Tribe’s work, still they showed
Robert the danger of organizing on the basis of hatred. In
a way he had known this all the time, but now his talks
with Father Callahan, with McCall and the Levins had
indelibly impressed it upon him. He felt himself nearer
to his mental state of mind immediately after the termination
of the <span class="lock">War—</span>when the American ideal of forbearance,
indulgence, charity, had electrified a <span class="lock">world—</span>than he had
ever been since. Democracy. Yes, democracy, that was it.</p>

<p>Robert decided to wait until he received a reply to his
telegram of resignation before notifying Freeman, grew impatient
as the morning wore on and finally determined to
rid himself of his impatience by walking. It was hot and
choking and <span class="lock">sooty—</span>not at all the Chicago of which he
had dreamed when he was in Georgia. It was impossible
to get used to Chicago. It was hot, but not like Corinth.
It was hard to breathe. On Michigan avenue, however,
in spite of the smoke from the lines of trains that ran along
the shore, one could at least see Lake Michigan, stretching
calmly out to the horizon in the golden sunlight, bearing
proud white steamers and occasional <span class="lock">sails—</span>and the only
restful thing, it seemed, in the whole feverish metropolis.
And so he walked, past the Art Institute, to the north where
workingmen high above were placing blocks of dazzling
white terra cotta on a tall tower that rose just beyond the
bridge at a curve in the boulevard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span></p>

<p>He wondered how it would feel to stand perched there
high above the <span class="lock">city—</span>with its swarming traffic, its noise and
soot, its passions and <span class="lock">hatreds—</span>God peering down on the
world he had fashioned. He looked at his <span class="lock">watch—</span>it was
almost <span class="lock">eleven—</span>and decided to return to his hotel.</p>

<p>McCall was waiting for him.</p>

<p>“I noticed a couple of telegrams in your box,” he said.</p>

<p>“A couple?” Robert wondered why there should be two.
He opened the first. It was from Griffith, a mixture of
threat and Tribal mystery. He could imagine Griffith grinning
while he wrote it, wracking his brain to coin something
staggering, and satisfied with his work. It read:</p>

<p>“We know what we are doing. Remember your oath.
Death to the faithless is necessary to preserve faith in the
deathless.”</p>

<p>The second telegram was briefer:</p>

<p>“Have learned all. Am returning ring. Margaret.”</p>

<p>Margaret! She, too, had turned against him. He remembered
her outburst of anger at home, when he had discussed
resigning from the Tribe. But how had she learned of his
resignation? Who—? Ah! Robert had an intuition. Pinkney.
Pinkney, of course. Pinkney, who had wanted Margaret
all the time. Pinkney, who had induced him to join
the Tribe and undertake the organization of the middle
West. He could see it all. Pinkney, with his fresh, pink
cheeks, bursting into the Forsythe home, with the announcement
that Hamilton had turned traitor to the South, to one
hundred per cent Americanism, to the Constitution, to the
sanctity of the home, to the dozen other glittering formulae
that masked the crude program of racial and religious persecution.
Robert felt anger, anger against Margaret, but
principally against <span class="lock">Pinkney—</span>and relief.</p>

<p>He handed the telegrams to McCall, one by one.</p>

<p>“You may use the first one,” he said.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t let that worry you. They’ll probably send
you a few notes of warning, with pictures of skulls and
cross bones. There’s a story in The Times this morning
about—” His eyes took in the second telegram.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span></p>

<p>“<span class="lock">Why—</span>why, old man, this <em>is</em> tough. Have you quarreled?”</p>

<p>Robert told him of Margaret’s fanatic enthusiasm for
the Tribe, especially its mission of protecting the home.
As he did so, he felt the blow to his pride. He was glad
of <span class="lock">it—</span>yet to be jilted!</p>

<p>“Protecting the home, eh!” exploded McCall. “Why more
than half the men drafted from the South had the clap.
Oh, I beg your pardon, Ham. I forgot for a moment. Oh,
well, we’re almost as bad here. Probably worse in Chicago.
But at least we don’t go round posing as home protectors.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well,” said Robert, with a little shrug of the shoulders,
“I don’t know. I don’t feel crushed, but it—”</p>

<p>His thoughts somehow jumped to Dorothy and his
heart beat faster.</p>

<p>“Crushed!” McCall slapped him on the back. “That’s
the luckiest thing in the world for you. Why, you’re still
young. You know, you’ll be a long time married. I
thought that I was the only sensible person left.”</p>

<p>“What do you <span class="lock">mean—</span>only sensible person?”</p>

<p>“You know what I told you about Levin and Miss
Meadows.”</p>

<p>“Levin. Dorothy!”</p>

<p>“Sure, at the Press Club, that first day. No, by George,
I was called away before I had a chance. You know they
met in France. It’s one of those war romances. He a
doctor and she a nurse in the same hospital. Of course,
it’s not a regular engagement. His father is orthodox
and—”</p>

<p>McCall’s voice went on. Robert heard it in snatches.
He remembered Dorothy speaking about religious tolerance,
about intermarriage. No, that would make no difference
with her. And Levin, too. His mouth felt dry. He was
talking at random? “<span class="lock">Yes—</span>Splendid <span class="lock">girl—</span>Beautiful—Nice
chap—”</p>

<p>They drifted down to Washington street and into a little
restaurant. Robert noticed the <span class="lock">name—</span>Ye Pot and <span class="lock">Kettle—</span>painted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
under a picture of a large, old-fashioned pot, on
the window.</p>

<p>“Thought it would be a little quieter here,” McCall was
saying.</p>

<p>“Yes.” He looked at the menu. A waitress was proclaiming
the merits of the day’s specialties. He ordered
something. He was conscious of a buzz of voices and the
sound of plates and cutlery.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter? You look pale.” McCall leaned
forward, his face anxious. “Aren’t you hungry? Better
take some coffee. It’ll do you good.”</p>

<p>“No, I’m not very hungry,” he said, but sipped the coffee.
“I’m going to the office.”</p>

<p>“It’s only twelve-thirty.”</p>

<p>“I’ll walk around a while.”</p>

<p>They walked slowly around the grim, gray city hall.</p>

<p>Robert shook off his weariness. Outside the entrance to
the office building they paused. McCall lit a cigarette.</p>

<p>“I’ve got to interview some one at the Palmer House,”
he said, throwing away the match. “Want a pill? Meet
me there as soon as you’re through. There’s some sort of
a conference going on.”</p>

<p>“All right. In the lobby.”</p>

<p>The outer office of the Dearborn Statistical Bureau was
<span class="lock">empty—</span>the office force was still at <span class="lock">lunch—</span>but Freeman, in
his shirt sleeves, was bending over his desk in his private
sanctum. Robert entered.</p>

<p>“I’ve resigned—” he began.</p>

<p>Freeman stood up, a sneer on his face.</p>

<p>“Yes, I got a telegram, telling me you’d quit. Well,
there was another fellow who also quit.” He shoved over
the morning paper. One of the stories on the second page
was marked. It told of a former Grand Bogey of the
Tribe who had committed suicide after receiving threatening
letters. As Robert read, he could hear Freeman breathing
and felt that he was pulling himself together. He
looked up.</p>

<p>“Well—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span></p>

<p>“You damned coward, quitting now because you’re afraid
of a few coons!”</p>

<p>“What!” Robert bit his lips and felt the muscles of his
arms and legs suddenly tighten.</p>

<p>“You heard me! You didn’t resign before. You waited
until this nigger trouble began and then you quit. I said
you were a damned coward!”</p>

<p>Robert took a step forward. Freeman’s huge fists were
clenched. He knew that he was white and trembling.</p>

<p>“You take that back!”</p>

<p>Freeman took a single step to one side, so that the
desk no longer stood between them. His lips were frozen
in a sneer. The corners of his eye-lids were drawn down.
He looked straight, unflinchingly into Robert’s eyes.</p>

<p>Robert felt the blood pounding in his temples and rushing
from his heart through his limbs, and with a sudden
movement, that was almost a leap, he drove his right fist
with all his strength at Freeman’s chin. The latter skilfully
threw his left forearm across his face and slightly
ducked, slightly tilted his head to one side. Robert’s fist
struck his opponent’s forearm and the top of his skull, and
a sharp pain shivered through his wrist.</p>

<p>“Ah.” Freeman’s teeth were bared. He was terribly
cool. He collected himself and sprang forward. Robert
was thinking of his chest. The blow caught him high on
the side of the head and sent him backward into the door,
which crashed shut. Robert covered. His right hand was
useless. His chest! His face and solar plexus had to be
protected. It was impossible to protect all of them and still
fight. He decided to wait, head down, forearms forming a
shield. He saw an opening and jabbed suddenly with his
left. Freeman’s head snapped back and a stream of blood
issued from the corner of his mouth. Robert fiercely lashed
out again at the same spot and Freeman fell blindly into a
clinch. His weight was forcing Robert slowly backward
toward the door. He tried to free himself. Freeman held
on desperately and tried to backheel him.</p>

<p>Slowly something that he had learned came into Robert’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>
mind. Something his wrestling instructor had told him at
Harvard. “If you ever get into a free-for-all—” What
was it? His head was whirling. He was being pressed
back. If he could only use his right arm. Freeman suddenly
backed off and in that instant Robert remembered.
He drove the heel of his left hand full at Freeman’s chin,
the fingers spread out across his face. Freeman straightened
up and threw up his hands. Like a flash Robert had
fallen on one knee, tackled his adversary about the ankles,
thrown him over his shoulder like a sack of wheat, staggered
about in a circle for a few steps <span class="lock">and—</span>dropped him.
Freeman struck the floor on the back of his head with a
crash and lay stunned for a second. Robert staggered back
against the wall. Freeman had backheeled him. It was
fair. His right hand was helpless. He saw Freeman rise
slowly, shake his head and lunge heavily forward. Robert
grinned. He ducked under the outstretched arm and struck
straight out at the pit of his stomach with his left. Freeman
collapsed and lay in a heap, his collar loosened, his tie
twisted around his neck, his hair and face dripping with
perspiration, the corner of his mouth swollen and streaked
with red.</p>

<p>A voice outside in the hall: “What’s going on there!”
Footsteps in the office. “Anybody there?” Silence. The
footsteps retreating. Freeman raised his head. Robert
bent down and pushed it back and sat astride his chest.</p>

<p>“Am I a coward?”</p>

<p>“Let up, you damned—”</p>

<p>Robert shoved his head back with his open hand.</p>

<p>“Am I a coward?”</p>

<p>Freeman gurgled. His face was red. Robert withdrew
his hand.</p>

<p>“Am I—” His hand clutched forward.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Am I a coward to quit a bunch of men who fight in the
dark? Am I a coward when I know that I’ll be threatened
with death for resigning?”</p>

<p>“No. Let me up.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span></p>

<p>Freeman’s face was red. He was panting.</p>

<p>“Shake hands first and say we’re friends!”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Shake hands and say we’re friends!”</p>

<p>Freeman looked startled, as though he were talking to a
mad man, but held up his hand.</p>

<p>“Now before I let you up.” He shifted his position forward
a trifle and Freeman winced. “Before I let you up,
listen to this: I quit because I learned that the Tribe’s stuff
about the Jews and the Catholics is all bunk. I was a damn
fool. But when I was shown, I did the square thing. I
quit. Now you’re going to do exactly what I tell you.
You’re going to see the same persons I saw. And if they
convince you, you’re going to quit, too. Is that agreed?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Let me up for God’s sake. I’m choking.”</p>

<p>“First shake on it.”</p>

<p>They shook. Robert sprang to his feet and helped Freeman
to his.</p>

<p>“I haven’t a damned thing against you, Freeman. In
fact, I always liked you. There’s nothing personal about
this, excepting you called me something that we don’t call
friends where I come from.”</p>

<p>Together they brushed off Freeman’s trousers.</p>

<p>“The stenographer is back,” said Robert. “I’ll send her
for collars and court plaster. Never mind, I’ll pay.”</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes later, washed, combed, in clean collars
and with Freeman’s cut lip neatly concealed by plaster, they
set out to find McCall.</p>

</div>

<p>McCall was walking impatiently back and forth in front
of the hotel, smoking a cigarette, when Robert and Freeman
arrived.</p>

<p>“I’ve been waiting for you,” he said. “Oh, we’ve met
before. Trick Track Tribe. I mean Dearborn Publicity
Bureau.”</p>

<p>Freeman grinned sheepishly.</p>

<p>“Yes, we’ve met.”</p>

<p>Robert’s attention was diverted by the appearance of a
taxi, driving up to the curb. The door opened and a black
man stepped out. A black man!</p>

<p>“There’s Williams!” cried Robert.</p>

<p>“Who?”</p>

<p>“Williams. You know, Mac, the <span class="lock">hospital—</span>France.”</p>

<p>It was Williams and suddenly, somehow, Robert found
himself shaking his <span class="lock">hand—</span>the first time in his life that he
had ever grasped the hand of any colored man, except
George, the chauffeur, and Sam, the gardener.</p>

<p>“You’ve changed.” The colored man was smiling.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ve got a new view of things. <span class="lock">I—</span>I’ve read your
articles in <cite>The Torch</cite> and I want to tell you that I agree
with your stand against the Trick Track Tribe. It must
be fought through education, not by stirring up a new and
stronger prejudice against it, even if we are stronger.”</p>

<p>Williams was pleased. He paid off the driver and explained
that he was attending a meeting of state officials, of
representative white and black citizens to discuss the race
riots.</p>

<p>The taxi pulled away. And suddenly Williams, Ph.D.,
Harvard, wearer of the <i>Croix de Guerre</i> and editor of <cite>The
Torch</cite>, stood revealed to the white world. The hated color
had suddenly reappeared.</p>

<p>“Yeh, look at the nigger! Skunk! Skunk!” the shrill
voice of an office boy, a pink-cheeked lad of perhaps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
thirteen, cried out, as he darted across the crowded street.
A stone struck the black man on the arm. Robert saw
what was coming. The world which had drifted by a
moment before had suddenly become electrified. “Nigger!
Get the coon! Get the damn murderer! Nigger! Nigger!”
A hundred angry voices, cursing.</p>

<p>A broker’s clerk came yelling. A bank teller followed.
Two law students. Salesmen. Shop managers. Men.
Boys. Women. Men in work shirts. Men in jazz ties.
Men in silk shirts. Black! Black! Black! Black raged
through their hearts. They screamed and whooped and
ran forward with faces distorted and arms raised.</p>

<p>“Quick, the door!”</p>

<p>Robert started toward the entrance. A white man barred
the way. Robert pulled him to one side. The man raised
his arm, but Freeman and McCall had sprung forward and
were holding him helpless. The black man leaped through
the doorway and to safety. McCall and Freeman ran after
him, for to aid a Negro then was a crime in the eyes of the
mob which hated blackness.</p>

<p>Robert started to follow. Something struck him on the
forehead. The cries of the mob and the sound of their
footsteps, a man’s laughter, the traffic clangs and noises,
the far-off whistle of a patrolman, whirled about him. The
world turned red and went spinning round and <span class="lock">round—</span>then
black, in circles, closing, closing. A confused roar,
fainter and ever fainter in his ears. A sensation of being
carried, of floating, finally of resting.</p>

<p>Somewhere Robert presently was aware of a light, a
flame that was at the same time himself. The flame grew
outward and shattered into other flames. The light expanded,
throbbing. He was running forward through a
grotesquely flaring night, with lights and rockets that
screamed overhead and exaggerated every irregularity of
the ground, that sent ghastly shadows staggering across
the field.</p>

<p>No. He was running down a football field with a leather
ball tucked under his arm, a smell of earth and blood and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>
leather in his nostrils and the roar of voices in his ears.
No. He tried to remember and found that he was conscious.
His eyes fluttered open. Eyes strangely familiar
were resting on them.</p>

<p>“Where am I? What’s happened?”</p>

<p>Soft hands were patting him. He felt the pressure of a
bandage around his head and a dull pain. He saw a doctor
and a woman bending over him. He knew that he was in
a hospital. He heard a familiar voice, the woman’s voice,
consoling him.</p>

<p>“Robert, Robert, you’re all right now?”</p>

<p>There was a hum of voices. There were tears in her
brown eyes. Oh, Dorothy! His heart was racing. Dorothy.
No. Yes, it <em>was</em> Dorothy. Dorothy of the hospital.
Dorothy who had wept once before, in Paris. Dorothy who
had kissed him then. Yes. His head was clear. He raised
himself to a sitting position.</p>

<p>She was holding his hand. His own eyes were wet.</p>

<p>“Why? Why?—”</p>

<p>“Robert, Robert.” She was bending over him. Her hair
was brushing against his face. He felt a glow of warmth.
Then her lips against his. Her eyes were closed. He closed
his own.</p>

<p>“Dorothy.” His head was clear. He remembered everything.
“But why are you here?”</p>

<p>“I heard you had been hurt. I <span class="lock">thought—</span>I thought it
was serious. But it isn’t. I’m so glad,” she sobbed.</p>

<p>“But why did you come?”</p>

<p>“<span class="lock">Because—</span>because—” She looked full into his eyes and
he could see little sparks of light dancing in them. “I love
you, Robert.”</p>

<p>His heart gave a bound.</p>

<p>“But—” He remembered. Oh, yes, McCall. “But I
thought that Jack Levin—”</p>

<p>“No.” She shook her head. “We are of different faiths.
We—”</p>
